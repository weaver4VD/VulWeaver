However, the explanation lacks detail on how user inputs are handled and whether parameterized queries or ORM are used to mitigate this risk. Without this information, the correctness score is limited. The severity of SQL Injection is high as it can lead to data breaches, but the profitability depends on the data's value and the system's architecture.",

However, it does not specify whether there are any existing controls like file type validation, size limits, or storage location restrictions. These factors are crucial in assessing the vulnerability's severity and profitability. Unrestricted file uploads can lead to server compromise, making the severity high, but profitability depends on the attacker's goals and the server's role.",
