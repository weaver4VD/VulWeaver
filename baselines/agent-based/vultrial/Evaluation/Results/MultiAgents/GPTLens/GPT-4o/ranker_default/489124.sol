However, the explanation lacks depth in discussing how prepared statements or parameterized queries can mitigate this risk. The severity of SQL Injection is high as it can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation. Profitability is also high for attackers as they can exploit this to gain sensitive information or control over the database.",
