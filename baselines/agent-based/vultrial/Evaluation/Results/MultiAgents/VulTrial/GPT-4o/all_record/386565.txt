To mitigate this, I suggest adding a check to ensure 'groupValue' is within a safe range before conversion.

The function is designed to be called with 'groupCode' 90 before any other group codes, ensuring the array is initialized. However, to further ensure robustness, we can add a check to confirm that 'vertices' is not null before accessing it, which would prevent any use of uninitialized memory."

{
    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified four main vulnerabilities: a potential memory leak due to the lack of proper deallocation of the 'vertices' array, an integer overflow risk when converting 'groupValue' to 'maxVertices', a buffer overflow risk due to inadequate bounds checking on the 'vertices' array, and the use of uninitialized memory if 'groupCode' is not 90 before accessing the array.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledges the memory leak and integer overflow risks, proposing a destructor for proper deallocation and adding range checks for 'groupValue'. For buffer overflow, they suggest enhanced bounds checking. The author refutes the uninitialized memory concern, stating the array is initialized when 'groupCode' is 90, but agrees to add a null check for robustness."
