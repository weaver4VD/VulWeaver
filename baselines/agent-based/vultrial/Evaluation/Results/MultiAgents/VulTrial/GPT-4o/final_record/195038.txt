    "justification": "The Code Author's explanation is valid. The use of 'mrb_get_args' with the '|i' format string is appropriate for the expected use case, and the function's behavior is correctly handled in the current implementation. There are no additional failure modes applicable in this context."

    "justification": "The Code Author's response is accurate. The function 'mrb_ary_ptr(self)' is expected to return a valid pointer for valid array objects, and the code already includes a check for empty arrays. The assumption of a valid array object is consistent with the function's intended use."
