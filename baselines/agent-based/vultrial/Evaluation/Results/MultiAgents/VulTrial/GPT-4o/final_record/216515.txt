        "severity": "medium",

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential memory leaks or inconsistent state due to lack of cleanup on memory allocation failure is valid. The Code Author's proposed mitigation to add a cleanup routine is appropriate and should be implemented to ensure the system remains in a consistent state."

        "justification": "The potential for integer overflow in the calculation of `ticklen + 6` is a serious issue that could allow attackers to bypass security checks. The Code Author's suggestion to add a check to ensure `ticklen` is within a safe range is necessary to prevent this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The lack of checking the return value of `EVP_Digest` could lead to incorrect session handling, which is a valid concern. The Code Author's proposal to add error handling for the return value is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of session management."
