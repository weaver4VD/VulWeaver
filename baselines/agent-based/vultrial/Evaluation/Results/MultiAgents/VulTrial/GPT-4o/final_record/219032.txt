    "vulnerability": "Improper Input Validation",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code correctly checks if the input size is greater than 2, which aligns with the requirement that a Reshape node must have at most 2 inputs. The error message is consistent with this logic, indicating an error if the input size exceeds 2. Therefore, there is no improper input validation in this context."

    "vulnerability": "Use of Unchecked Return Value",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "enhance error messages",
    "justification": "While the current implementation does return an internal error when `EvaluateNode` fails, it could be improved by including more specific error details. Enhancing the error message to include the status message from `EvaluateNode` would provide more context for debugging and error handling, thus partially addressing the concern."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Memory Leak",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The use of `gtl::MakeCleanup` ensures that the cleanup function is executed when the scope is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurs. This mechanism is designed to prevent memory leaks by guaranteeing that the allocated memory for tensors is freed, thus addressing the concern of potential memory leaks."

    "vulnerability": "Lack of Type Checking",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "implement type checks",
    "justification": "The code currently assumes that the dtype of `outputs[0]` is either `DT_INT32` or `DT_INT64`. Adding an explicit check for the dtype of `outputs[0]` before processing would ensure that only supported data types are handled, preventing potential crashes or incorrect behavior. This mitigation would address the risk of undefined behavior."
