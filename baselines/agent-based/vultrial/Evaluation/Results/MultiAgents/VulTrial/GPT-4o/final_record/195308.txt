        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identifies that blocking clone3() entirely is a mitigation strategy, but it does not address potential future syscalls that may also need filtering. The Code Author's approach to block clone3() and return ENOSYS is a valid mitigation, but regular updates to the syscall blocklist are necessary to maintain security."
