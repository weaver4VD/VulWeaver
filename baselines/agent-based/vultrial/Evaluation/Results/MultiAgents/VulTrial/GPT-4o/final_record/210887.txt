The Code Author acknowledges this issue and suggests implementing checks, which confirms the validity of the vulnerability. Given the potential for arbitrary code execution, the severity is high, and immediate action is recommended."

        "justification": "The function assumes `nc` and `nc->info` are valid without checks, which could lead to a crash if they are NULL. The Code Author agrees with this assessment and proposes adding checks. This confirms the validity of the vulnerability. While the impact is primarily a denial of service, it is critical to fix to ensure system stability, thus a medium severity is assigned."

The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests adding error handling. This confirms the validity of the vulnerability. The lack of error handling could lead to data corruption or other issues, warranting a medium severity and immediate fix."
