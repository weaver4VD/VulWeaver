        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified that the code reads integer values from the bitstream without checking for potential overflows. This can lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. The Code Author's suggestion to add checks is appropriate, but the current code is vulnerable."

        "justification": "While the Code Author is correct that the allocation sizes are based on fixed structure sizes, the lack of explicit checks for allocation size could still lead to issues if the input data is manipulated. Monitoring and potentially adding checks for allocation size could prevent denial of service attacks."
