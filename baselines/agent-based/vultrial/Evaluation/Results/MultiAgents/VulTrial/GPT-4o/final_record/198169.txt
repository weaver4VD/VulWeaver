    "justification": "The function's design to return nullptr is intentional and requires the caller to handle it properly, which is a common practice in C/C++ programming. However, the potential for a null pointer dereference exists if the caller fails to check the return value. While this is more of a usage issue than a flaw in the function itself, it could lead to crashes if not handled correctly. Therefore, it is partially valid, but the severity is low as it relies on the caller's implementation."

    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The lack of input validation is a valid concern as it could lead to undefined behavior if invalid inputs are passed to the function. This could result in memory corruption or crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited. Adding input validation checks would enhance the function's robustness and prevent these issues, making it a necessary fix."
