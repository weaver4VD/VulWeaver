This can lead to a buffer overflow if 'buf' is smaller than expected, potentially allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code. The Code Author's proposal to add bounds checking is appropriate and should be implemented immediately to prevent exploitation."

The result is stored in 'attr->err_code', which can handle the maximum possible value of this expression without overflow.
