        "justification": "The use of `sprintf` without bounds checking is a well-known source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This can lead to memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution, which is a critical security risk. The proposed mitigation of using `snprintf` is appropriate and should be implemented immediately to prevent exploitation."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The lack of a check after memory allocation with `gf_malloc` is a valid concern. If the allocation fails, it could lead to dereferencing a null pointer, causing crashes or undefined behavior. This should be addressed by checking the allocation result and handling failures gracefully to ensure application stability."

        "justification": "While the use of `sprintf` is indeed insecure, the primary concern overlaps with the buffer overflow issue. However, replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf` is a good practice to enhance security by ensuring bounds checking, and should be done to prevent potential vulnerabilities."

        "justification": "The absence of input validation before processing data, especially when encoding with `gf_base64_encode`, is a valid concern. Malformed or malicious input could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Implementing input validation checks is necessary to ensure data integrity and security."
