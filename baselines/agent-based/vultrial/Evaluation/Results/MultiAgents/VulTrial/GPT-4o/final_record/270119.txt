    "justification": "The function's design to return nullptr when the tensor is not a variable is intentional and aligns with standard C/C++ practices. It is the caller's responsibility to check for nullptr before dereferencing, which is a common requirement in pointer-based programming. The potential for a null pointer dereference is not due to a flaw in the function itself but rather improper usage by the caller."

This is a valid concern as it could be exploited if an out-of-bounds index is provided. The Code Author's proposal to add a bounds check is a necessary mitigation to enhance the function's robustness and prevent potential security issues."
