        "justification": "The code does not perform comprehensive validation on the 'keyid' input, which could lead to security issues if 'keyid' is user-controlled. The proposed mitigation by the Code Author to use regular expressions and set length constraints is a valid approach to prevent potential buffer overflows or injection attacks."

        "justification": "The lack of input sanitization for 'keyid' poses a significant risk of injection attacks, such as command injection or format string vulnerabilities. The Code Author's suggestion to sanitize the input and use safe functions is necessary to mitigate these risks effectively."

        "justification": "While the potential for a memory leak exists if the memory allocated for 'safe_keyid' is not managed properly, the impact is relatively low unless the function is called repeatedly without proper memory management. The Code Author's proposal to free memory when the 'gpg' context is destroyed or the recipients list is cleared is a reasonable approach to prevent memory leaks."
