    "justification": "The Code Author's refutation is valid. The `snprintf` function is used to convert a port number to a string, and the buffer size is sufficient to hold the maximum possible output. The risk of truncation or failure in this context is negligible."

    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The Security Researcher's identification of the incorrect error check for `getaddrinfo` is accurate. The function should check for `ret != 0` to handle errors correctly. This could lead to undefined behavior if not addressed."
