        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified that while there is a check for 'offs', other arithmetic operations like 'offs + sizeof(sh)' and 'o4 + l' are not checked for overflow. This could lead to incorrect memory access, which is a serious issue that could be exploited for arbitrary code execution."
