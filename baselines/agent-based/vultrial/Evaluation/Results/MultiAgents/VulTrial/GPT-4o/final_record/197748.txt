The constraints on tensor dimensions ensure that 'rank' will not exceed the bounds of 'int32_t'. The Code Author's refutation is valid, and there is no risk of integer overflow in this context."

The check for 'in_idx' being out of range is correctly implemented, and the function returns an error if this condition is met.
