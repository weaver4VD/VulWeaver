The responsibility for ensuring 'dominify' is properly initialized lies with the caller, not within the function itself. Therefore, the concern about 'minify' being uninitialized is unfounded."

Adding input validation to ensure 'dominify' is within an expected range is a prudent measure to prevent potential logic errors or security issues."

This check is sufficient to prevent a null pointer dereference within the current logic. Future changes may require additional checks, but the current implementation is safe from null pointer dereference."
