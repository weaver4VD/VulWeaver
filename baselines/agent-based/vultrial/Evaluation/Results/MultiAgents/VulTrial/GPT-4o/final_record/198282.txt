    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",

    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The use of int64_t provides a large range for integer values, and TensorFlow's framework includes checks to prevent overflow. The input validation ensures non-negative dimensions, further reducing the risk of overflow. The operations are typical for tensor manipulations and are unlikely to exceed the limits of int64_t."

    "vulnerability": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While TensorFlow is designed to handle large-scale operations, there is a potential risk if input tensors are extremely large, leading to resource exhaustion. Implementing additional checks to limit input sizes can mitigate this risk. Monitoring for unusually large inputs can help prevent potential DoS scenarios."

    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Memory Allocation",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "The reliance on TensorFlow's internal memory allocation checks is generally safe, but additional constraints on tensor dimensions can prevent excessive memory usage. Monitoring memory allocation patterns can help identify potential issues before they affect system stability."

    "vulnerability": "Lack of Input Validation",

    "justification": "The function includes comprehensive validation for tensor shapes, ensuring they meet expected criteria. The controlled environment where the function operates reduces the risk of improper input validation. The existing checks are sufficient for the intended use case."
