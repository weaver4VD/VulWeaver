{
    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified three main vulnerabilities: Double Free, Use After Free, and Dangling Pointer. The Double Free vulnerability arises because pointers are not set to NULL after deletion, which could lead to attempts to delete already freed memory if the destructor is called again. The Use After Free issue is due to the 'player' pointer not being set to NULL after deletion, risking access to freed memory. The Dangling Pointer problem is similar, with 'mixer', 'audioDriverName', and 'listener' pointers not being set to NULL, potentially leading to undefined behavior if accessed later.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledges the vulnerabilities and proposes mitigation strategies. For the Double Free issue, they suggest setting pointers to NULL after deletion to prevent re-deletion. To address the Use After Free vulnerability, they plan to set the 'player' pointer to NULL post-deletion, preventing accidental access. For the Dangling Pointer issue, they propose setting 'mixer', 'audioDriverName', and 'listener' pointers to NULL after deletion to avoid undefined behavior and enhance program stability and security."

If the destructor is called multiple times on the same object, the absence of setting pointers to NULL after deletion could lead to attempts to delete already freed memory.
