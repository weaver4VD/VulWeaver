        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The use of `memcpy` without proper bounds checking can indeed lead to buffer overflows, which are critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited for arbitrary code execution. The Code Author's suggestion to ensure proper allocation checks and use safer functions is a valid mitigation strategy."

        "justification": "Arithmetic operations without overflow checks can lead to incorrect memory allocations, potentially causing buffer overflows. The Code Author's plan to implement checks to prevent exceeding `UINT32_MAX` is a necessary step to mitigate this risk."
