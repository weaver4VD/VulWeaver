This can be achieved by adding a condition in the loop to verify that the rb_hdr pointer remains within the allocated memory of the packet.

To mitigate this, we can implement rate limiting or introduce a timeout mechanism to control the processing of incoming packets.

    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified four main vulnerabilities: 1) Buffer Overflow due to inadequate bounds checking on packet data, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or crashes. 2) Integer Overflow in the calculation of pkt_len and rb_len, which could lead to incorrect memory access. 3) Lack of Input Validation, as the function does not ensure the packet is well-formed, risking unexpected behavior or exploitation. 4) Potential Denial of Service from unregulated packet processing, which could exhaust system resources.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledges the vulnerabilities and proposes mitigations: 1) For Buffer Overflow, enhance bounds checking to ensure rb_hdr remains within packet bounds. 2) For Integer Overflow, implement checks to keep values within safe limits. 3) For Lack of Input Validation, introduce checks to validate packet structure and size. 4) For Denial of Service, implement rate limiting or timeouts to control packet processing and prevent resource exhaustion."
