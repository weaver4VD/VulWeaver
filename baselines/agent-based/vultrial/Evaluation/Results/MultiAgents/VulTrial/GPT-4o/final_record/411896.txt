    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "The code author acknowledges that while many return values are checked, there are instances where additional checks could enhance robustness. This aligns with the researcher's concern, indicating that the issue is partially valid. Monitoring and adding checks where necessary would improve the code's reliability."

    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code author refutes this claim, noting that `memcpy` is used with explicit size parameters and `strcpy` is not present. The researcher's concern does not align with the actual code usage, making this vulnerability invalid."
