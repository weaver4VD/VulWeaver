    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Input",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The function is designed to operate on well-formed inputs, which are expected to be validated at earlier stages in the system. The assumption of well-formed inputs is standard practice for internal functions, and the primary purpose of this function is to compare attributes, not validate them. Therefore, the concern about unchecked input is not applicable in this context."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Denial of Service via Large Input",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the function itself does not impose limits on input sizes, it is reasonable to expect that input size checks are implemented at the system level. However, the potential for resource exhaustion due to large inputs is a valid concern. Monitoring and setting maximum allowable sizes for these fields in the configuration or input validation layers can mitigate this risk."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Debugging Information Disclosure",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The use of DCHECK with potentially sensitive information in debugging messages can lead to information disclosure if debugging is enabled in production. Ensuring that production builds are compiled with debugging disabled and using configurable logging mechanisms can prevent this issue. This is a valid concern that should be addressed to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive information."
