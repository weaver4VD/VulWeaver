        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the risk of integer overflow due to the lack of checks on 's->size'. The Code Author acknowledges this and proposes a mitigation strategy. Given the potential for insufficient memory allocation leading to buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution, this vulnerability is valid and severe."

        "justification": "The function does not verify that 's->size' is within the bounds of the available data in 'bs', which can lead to reading beyond the bitstream's end. Both the Security Researcher and Code Author agree on this point, and the potential for data corruption or code execution makes this a high-severity issue that needs immediate attention."

        "justification": "The absence of input validation for 's->size' and other critical inputs is a valid concern. The Code Author agrees and suggests implementing validation checks. While this issue is not as immediately dangerous as the other two, it still poses a significant risk of unexpected behavior and should be addressed promptly."
