        "justification": "The lack of input validation for parameters like `max_table_size`, `dyn_table_size`, and `max_risked_streams` can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if these values are outside expected ranges. The Code Author acknowledges this and proposes adding validation checks, which is a necessary step to prevent potential vulnerabilities."

        "justification": "The Code Author refutes the buffer overflow concern by explaining that `lsqpack_enc_init` is a well-tested component designed to handle buffer sizes correctly. Without evidence to the contrary, the risk of a buffer overflow is minimal, and no further action is needed."

The Code Author's suggestion to implement additional error handling logic is necessary to maintain consistent states and prevent resource leaks, enhancing the function's robustness."
