    "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about integer overflow is valid. If the size is large enough, it could cause an overflow when calculating `alloc_size`, leading to insufficient memory allocation. This poses a significant risk of buffer overflow, which can be exploited for arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The Code Author's suggestion to add checks and use safer arithmetic operations is appropriate and should be implemented immediately to prevent potential exploitation."

    "vulnerability": "Improper Check for Zero Allocation",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The check `if (alloc_size <= 0)` is indeed incorrect for a `size_t` type, which is unsigned and cannot be negative. This oversight could lead to attempts to allocate zero bytes, resulting in undefined behavior. The Code Author's agreement to update the condition to `if (alloc_size == 0)` is necessary to ensure the function behaves correctly and safely handles zero allocation cases. This fix should be applied immediately to prevent potential issues."
