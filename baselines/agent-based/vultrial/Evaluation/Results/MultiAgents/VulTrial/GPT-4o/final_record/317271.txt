The potential for improper access control is related to SELinux policy configuration, which is outside the scope of this function's implementation. Therefore, the concern is not valid in the context of the function itself."

While this does not pose an immediate security risk, enhancing error handling would improve diagnostics and system robustness. The Code Author's suggestion to introduce error logging and a fallback mechanism is a reasonable mitigation strategy."
