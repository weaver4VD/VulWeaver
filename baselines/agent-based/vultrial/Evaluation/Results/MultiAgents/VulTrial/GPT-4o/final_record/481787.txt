The assumption that 'buf' is a null-terminated string is reasonable in this context, and there is no evidence of writing beyond its bounds."

        "justification": "The use of 'nsock_printf' and 'nsock_printf_nul' with 'buf' without explicit format specifiers poses a risk if 'buf' contains user-controlled input with format specifiers. This could lead to a format string vulnerability, allowing an attacker to read or write arbitrary memory. Implementing format specifiers like '%s' can mitigate this risk."

        "justification": "While the function does not validate 'len' against the actual length of 'buf', the current usage assumes 'buf' is null-terminated and within expected bounds. Adding a check to ensure 'len' matches 'buf's length would enhance robustness, but the current risk is low given the context."
