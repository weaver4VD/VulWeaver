This macro checks the status of the operation and raises an error if retrieval fails, preventing null pointer dereference.

This approach is consistent with TensorFlow's error handling practices, ensuring that errors are reported with specific messages for easier debugging. The Code Author's refutation is valid."

This proactive validation prevents incorrect calculations or memory access violations. The Code Author's explanation is accurate, and the Security Researcher's concern is unfounded given the existing checks."
