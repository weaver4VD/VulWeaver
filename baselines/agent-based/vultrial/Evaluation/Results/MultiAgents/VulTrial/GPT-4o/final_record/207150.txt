        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher and Code Author both agree that the current error handling could be improved. The lack of context in error reporting can lead to confusion and potential exploitation. Enhancing error logging with more context is a necessary step to prevent these issues."

        "justification": "The Code Author's argument is valid; the function checks the object type, which is a reasonable form of validation in this context. The risk of external stack manipulation is minimal without prior compromise, making this vulnerability unlikely to be exploited."
