The 'labellen' variable is calculated to be the smaller of 'cap->card' or 'dev->card_label', ensuring that snprintf does not write beyond the bounds of 'cap->card'. This effectively prevents a buffer overflow, as the size parameter is correctly managed to fit within the destination buffer."

The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests a mitigation strategy. Implementing a validation step to ensure no sensitive information is copied would address this risk."
