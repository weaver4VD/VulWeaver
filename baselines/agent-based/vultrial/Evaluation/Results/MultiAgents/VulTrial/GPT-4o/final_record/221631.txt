    "vulnerability": "Improper Input Validation",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code includes a validation step by checking if `found_shape` is null after calling `GetValueInfo`. If `found_shape` is null, the function returns early, preventing any further operations on invalid data. This ensures that only valid input shapes are processed, mitigating the risk of unexpected behavior or crashes."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Null Dereference",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code explicitly checks for a null `found_shape` immediately after calling `GetValueInfo`. If `found_shape` is null, the function returns an empty `Optional`, effectively preventing any null dereference. This demonstrates that the code is designed to handle potential null values safely."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Lack of Error Handling",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the current code does not explicitly handle errors from operations like `ConstantOp`, `ConstantIndexOp`, and `ExtractOp`, these operations are typically expected to succeed in a controlled environment. However, adding error handling mechanisms would enhance robustness and ensure graceful management of unexpected failures."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code uses `size_t` for index calculations, which is an unsigned integer type designed to prevent overflow in typical use cases. The calculations are based on dimensions and ranks, which are inherently limited by the input data's size and structure, making overflow unlikely. The current implementation is sufficient, but additional checks could be added for further assurance if desired."
