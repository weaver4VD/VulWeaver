  {
    "vulnerability": "Improper Input Validation",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code correctly checks if the input size is less than 2, which aligns with the requirement that a Reshape node must have exactly 2 inputs. The error message is consistent with this logic, as it states the node must have at most 2 inputs. Therefore, there is no inconsistency or vulnerability in this aspect of the code."

    "vulnerability": "Use of Unchecked Return Values",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "Using TF_CHECK_OK can lead to abrupt program termination without allowing for graceful error handling or recovery. Replacing it with a more robust error handling mechanism that logs the error and returns a status would prevent unexpected termination and improve the program's resilience."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Potential Memory Leak",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The use of gtl::MakeCleanup ensures that the cleanup function is executed when the scope is exited, even if an exception is thrown. This guarantees that the memory allocated for tensors is freed, thus preventing a memory leak. The cleanup mechanism is robust and reliable in this context."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Lack of Error Handling for EvaluateNode",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the current implementation returns a generic error message, more detailed error handling could improve debugging. Enhancing the error message to include specific details about the failure would aid in quicker diagnosis and resolution, but the current implementation is not critically flawed."
