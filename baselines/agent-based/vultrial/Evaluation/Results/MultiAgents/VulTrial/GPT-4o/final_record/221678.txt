        "justification": "The use of SSLv23_client_method() is conditionally applied for OpenSSL versions below 1.1.0, where it is still valid. However, it is important to ensure that SSLv2 and SSLv3 are not enabled, as they are insecure. The code should be monitored to ensure that it does not inadvertently allow insecure protocols."
