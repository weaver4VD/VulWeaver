        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about integer overflow is valid. The calculation of `stream_len` using `stream_num * sizeof(__u16)` could indeed overflow if `stream_num` is large. The Code Author acknowledged this and suggested adding checks to prevent overflow, which is a necessary step to ensure the integrity of the calculation and prevent potential buffer overflows."

        "justification": "The Code Author's refutation is valid. The function `sctp_make_reconf` is designed to return NULL on failure, and the current implementation checks for this condition. There is no evidence to suggest that `sctp_make_reconf` could fail in a way that does not return NULL, making the Security Researcher's concern unfounded."

        "justification": "The potential for buffer overflow when using `sctp_addto_chunk` is a valid concern. The Code Author agreed with this assessment and proposed ensuring that `retval` is properly sized and adding checks before using `sctp_addto_chunk`. This is crucial to prevent buffer overflows, which could lead to severe security issues such as arbitrary code execution."

        "justification": "The lack of input validation is a valid concern. The Code Author agreed and suggested implementing validation checks to ensure parameters are within expected ranges and not NULL where applicable. Proper input validation is essential to prevent unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities, such as memory corruption or crashes."
