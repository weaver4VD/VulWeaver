        "justification": "The use of an empty Initialization Vector (IV) is a significant security risk as it can lead to predictable encryption patterns, making cryptographic attacks more feasible. The Code Author's proposal to enforce non-empty IVs and generate a random IV if none is provided is a necessary mitigation to ensure encryption remains secure."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "Using a password directly as a key or padding it with zeros does not adhere to cryptographic best practices. This can result in weak encryption keys that are vulnerable to brute force attacks. The Code Author's suggestion to use a key derivation function like PBKDF2 is a valid and necessary improvement to enhance the security of the encryption process."

        "justification": "The absence of error handling for critical EVP functions can lead to undefined behavior, including potential security vulnerabilities. Implementing error checks as proposed by the Code Author is essential to ensure the robustness and stability of the encryption process, preventing potential exploitation."
