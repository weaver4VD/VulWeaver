    "justification": "The Code Author's explanation is valid. The function handles all known and relevant fiber states explicitly. The default case is intentionally left open to accommodate future states without breaking existing functionality. This approach is reasonable and does not pose a security risk under the current implementation."

    "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern is valid. The function should verify that the stack extension is successful to prevent potential stack overflow or memory corruption. The Code Author's suggestion to add a check after `mrb_stack_extend` is a necessary mitigation to ensure robustness and prevent denial of service or potential code execution vulnerabilities."

    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the function assumes that the pointers are valid as part of the fiber context, adding checks to ensure they are not null would enhance robustness. The risk is low if the context is properly initialized, but adding these checks would prevent potential segmentation faults or undefined behavior, especially in edge cases or future code changes."

    "justification": "The lack of input validation for `len` and `a` is a valid concern. Without validation, there is a risk of buffer overflows or memory corruption if inputs are manipulated. Implementing checks to ensure `len` is within a reasonable range and `a` is not null is necessary to prevent potential security vulnerabilities."
