        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The use of `strcpy` without bounds checking is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input. The Code Author's suggestion to use `strncpy` is a valid mitigation strategy."

        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The format string used in `printf` is not user-controlled and is only present in a debug block. Therefore, it does not constitute a format string vulnerability. The Code Author's refutation is valid."
