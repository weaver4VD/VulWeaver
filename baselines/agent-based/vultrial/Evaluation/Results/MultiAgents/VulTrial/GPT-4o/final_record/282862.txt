    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about the unchecked return value of `rsi_prepare_beacon` is valid. If this function fails and the failure is not handled, it could lead to the transmission of incorrect data. The Code Author's proposal to add a check for the return value and handle errors appropriately is a necessary mitigation to prevent potential issues."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Memory Leak",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The Code Author's refutation is correct. The function `rsi_send_beacon` already includes a mechanism to free the allocated memory if `rsi_prepare_beacon` fails. There are no additional operations after `rsi_prepare_beacon` that could lead to a memory leak, so the concern is unfounded in this context."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Improper Memory Alignment",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "The concern about improper memory alignment is partially valid. While the current alignment logic may not be suitable for all architectures, it does not necessarily lead to immediate issues. The Code Author's suggestion to make the alignment logic configurable is a reasonable approach to ensure compatibility with different hardware environments. Monitoring and adapting the alignment logic as needed is a prudent course of action."
