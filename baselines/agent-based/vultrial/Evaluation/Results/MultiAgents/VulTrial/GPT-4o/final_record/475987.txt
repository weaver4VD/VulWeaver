        "justification": "The code author correctly points out that there are sufficient checks in place to prevent out-of-bounds access. The checks ensure that 'code_new' is within valid bounds before accessing 'table[code_new]', thus preventing any out-of-bounds memory access."

        "justification": "While the current implementation does not explicitly check for integer overflow, the risk is mitigated by ensuring 'LZW_CODE_MAX' is defined within a safe range. However, adding explicit checks would further strengthen the code against potential future changes or misconfigurations."

In the case where 'code_new' is not in the table, 'last_value' is explicitly set to 'ctx->previous_code_first', which is initialized in previous operations. Therefore, there is no use of uninitialized variables in this code path."
