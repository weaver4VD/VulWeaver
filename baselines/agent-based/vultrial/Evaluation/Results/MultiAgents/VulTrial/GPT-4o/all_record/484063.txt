In production, state transitions will be managed through secure, validated processes that include checks to prevent unauthorized state changes. We will implement state validation mechanisms to ensure that state changes are only made under secure and verified conditions."

    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified four main vulnerabilities: (1) Hardcoded dummy credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access if not replaced in production. (2) Insecure default configuration, as using 'UA_ConnectionConfig_default' may expose the system to known vulnerabilities. (3) Lack of error handling, which could result in system instability or security breaches if functions fail. (4) Potential insecure state assignment, where setting the channel state to open without validation could be exploited to bypass security measures.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author responded with mitigation strategies: (1) Dummy credentials are for testing only, with plans to enforce configuration checks to prevent their use in production. (2) Default configurations are placeholders, with a policy to require secure, environment-specific settings in production. (3) Error handling will be implemented in production to ensure system integrity by logging errors and aborting operations safely. (4) State assignments are controlled in tests, with future plans for secure state validation processes to prevent unauthorized changes in production."
