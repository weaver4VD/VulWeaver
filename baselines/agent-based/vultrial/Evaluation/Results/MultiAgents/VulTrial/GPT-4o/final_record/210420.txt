The function does not check if dest_strip has enough space to accommodate the data being copied, which can lead to memory overwrites. The Code Author's suggestion to check the size of dest_strip against the total data size before copying is a necessary mitigation to prevent this high-severity issue."

        "justification": "The potential for integer overflow is a legitimate concern, but the likelihood of it occurring depends on the specific values of the parameters. Using size_t for width and tile parameters, as suggested by the Code Author, can mitigate this risk. However, the severity is medium because it could lead to buffer overflows if not monitored, but it is less immediate than the buffer overflow issue."

The Code Author's proposal to validate input parameters and ensure that src_strip and dest_strip are not null, and that the total size does not exceed dest_strip's allocation, is a necessary step to prevent this medium-severity issue."
