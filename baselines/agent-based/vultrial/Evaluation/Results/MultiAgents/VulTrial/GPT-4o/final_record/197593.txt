        "vulnerability": "Buffer Overflow",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about buffer overflow is valid as the code lacks bounds checking when copying data from `start` to `end` into `native->arguments` and `new`. This could indeed lead to a buffer overflow if `end` exceeds the allocated space, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or causing a crash. The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests implementing bounds checking, which is a necessary step to mitigate this high-severity vulnerability."

        "decision": "partially valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The Code Author refutes the claim by explaining that `native->arguments` and `native->local` are initialized based on the function's frame structure. However, the Security Researcher's concern about potential use of uninitialized memory is partially valid, as explicit checks to ensure pointers are in a known state before use would strengthen the code's robustness. Adding these checks would prevent potential undefined behavior, thus the decision is partially valid with medium severity."

        "vulnerability": "Improper Handling of Function Arguments",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about improper handling of function arguments is valid. The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests adding validation checks for `function->args_count` and `function->args_offset`. Without these checks, there is a risk of accessing out-of-bounds memory, which could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. Implementing these checks is crucial to ensure the function's argument handling is secure, making this a medium-severity issue that should be addressed promptly."
