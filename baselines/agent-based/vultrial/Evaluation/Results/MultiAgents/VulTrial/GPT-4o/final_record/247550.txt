    "justification": "The use of RELEASE_ASSERT for error handling in cryptographic operations is indeed a valid concern. It can lead to denial of service if an attacker can trigger assertion failures. The Code Author's suggestion to replace it with a more graceful error handling mechanism is appropriate and should be implemented to prevent potential service disruptions."

    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the potential for information leakage exists, the risk is mitigated if error messages are logged securely and not exposed to attackers. The Code Author's mitigation strategy to log errors securely is a reasonable approach. However, the risk remains low if proper logging practices are followed."

    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The lack of input validation is a significant security risk, as it could allow an attacker to manipulate inputs and affect hash computations. The Code Author's acknowledgment and proposed mitigation to implement validation checks are necessary to ensure the integrity of the validation process."

The Code Author's suggestion to allow configurable hash functions is a proactive measure to address potential future vulnerabilities. Monitoring the cryptographic landscape for any developments regarding SHA-256 is advisable."
