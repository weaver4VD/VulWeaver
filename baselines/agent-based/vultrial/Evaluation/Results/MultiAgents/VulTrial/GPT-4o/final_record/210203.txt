        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified that the lack of input validation for the `size` parameter could lead to resource exhaustion or denial of service. The Code Author acknowledges this issue and proposes a mitigation strategy, which indicates that the vulnerability is valid. Implementing a maximum threshold for `size` is a necessary step to prevent excessive memory allocation."

        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "While the Security Researcher raises a valid concern about potential integer overflow, the Code Author correctly points out that `unsigned long` is designed to handle large values, making overflow unlikely in typical scenarios. However, adding a range check as suggested by the Code Author is a prudent measure to ensure safety. The risk is minimal, but monitoring and implementing the suggested check can prevent unforeseen issues."
