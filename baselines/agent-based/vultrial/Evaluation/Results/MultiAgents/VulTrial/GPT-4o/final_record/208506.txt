        "justification": "The Code Author's explanation is valid. The code initializes variables before use, either directly or through function calls. Functions like memset are used to ensure variables are properly set, and the code structure supports this initialization process. Therefore, the claim of uninitialized variables is not substantiated."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about inconsistent error handling is partially valid. While the code does handle errors in many places, there are opportunities to improve consistency in error checking, especially with krb5 functions. The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests a review to ensure all function calls are consistently checked for errors. Improving error handling will enhance the robustness and stability of the code."
