    "recommended_action": "implement non-blocking alternative",

    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The Code Author correctly points out that the code ensures `data` is not null before dereferencing `data->socket` and `data->connection`. The existing checks are sufficient to prevent null pointer dereferences in this context."
