    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The function is part of a larger framework where input validation is handled at a higher level. This design pattern avoids redundant checks and improves performance, and the function's responsibility is to validate shapes and dimensions, which it does effectively."

    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The function includes comprehensive checks to ensure indices are within valid ranges, effectively preventing out-of-bounds access. It checks that each index is non-negative and less than the corresponding dimension size, demonstrating a robust approach to handling indices safely."
