    "recommended_action": "implement input size checks",
    "justification": "The code does not currently limit the size of input data or splits, which could lead to excessive memory allocation and potential denial of service. The Code Author's suggestion to add configurable maximum sizes is a valid mitigation strategy."

    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "implement overflow checks and use larger data types",
    "justification": "The arithmetic operations on integers could indeed lead to overflow, especially with large inputs. The Code Author's proposal to implement checks and use larger data types like `int64` is a reasonable mitigation approach."

    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code already includes a validation step ensuring `ngram_widths_` contains positive values, which addresses the concern raised by the Security Researcher. The existing validation is sufficient."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Buffer Overflow",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "review pointer usage and ensure bounds checking",
    "justification": "While the code uses `OP_REQUIRES` to check indices, the use of raw pointers still warrants careful review to ensure all potential edge cases are covered. The risk is low but not entirely unfounded."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Improper Handling of Edge Cases",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code handles edge cases where `splits_vec_size` or `input_data_size` is zero by returning early, which prevents further processing and potential issues. The concern is adequately addressed in the current implementation."
