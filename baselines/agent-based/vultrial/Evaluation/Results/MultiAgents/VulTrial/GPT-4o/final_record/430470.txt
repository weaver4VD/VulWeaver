        "vulnerability": "Buffer Overflow",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The use of a fixed-size buffer 'line' without proper bounds checking can lead to a buffer overflow, especially with the line 'line[llen + 1] = '\\0';' which can write beyond the allocated buffer size. This is a critical issue as it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or crash the program, posing a significant security risk."

    {
        "vulnerability": "Improper Input Validation",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code's lack of proper input validation, particularly when using 'strtok' and 'strchr', can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the input is malformed. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause information disclosure or denial of service, making it important to address promptly."

        "decision": "partially valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "While the use of functions like 'strtok', 'strcpy', and 'memcpy' can be insecure, the risk is mitigated if used with proper bounds checking. However, the current implementation lacks such checks, making it partially valid. Replacing these with safer alternatives and ensuring bounds checking is crucial."

        "vulnerability": "Potential Memory Leak",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The potential memory leak with 'escaped_selector' not being freed in all execution paths is a valid concern. Although the impact is less severe compared to other vulnerabilities, it can lead to resource exhaustion over time, warranting monitoring and ensuring proper memory management."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The construction of URLs using user-controlled input without proper validation or sanitization can lead to URL injection attacks. This vulnerability can be exploited to redirect users to malicious sites or conduct phishing attacks, making it important to implement input sanitization and validation."
