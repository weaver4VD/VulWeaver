    "justification": "While the potential for information leakage exists, the risk is mitigated if error messages are properly sanitized and access to logs is restricted. The Code Author's mitigation strategy is sound, but monitoring should be in place to ensure that no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed."

The Code Author's plan to implement input validation is necessary and should be prioritized to protect the system from potential exploitation."
