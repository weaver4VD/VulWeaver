        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern is valid as the code does not check if `datalen` exceeds the sizes of `cipher_suites` and `pk_algos` arrays, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The Code Author's suggestion to implement boundary checks is necessary to prevent this high-severity vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution or application crashes."

The existing checks ensure `datalen` is even, but additional validation on the content of `data` could enhance security. However, the risk is low due to the controlled processing of data."

The Code Author's suggestion to add a check for NULL is necessary to prevent potential application crashes, making this a medium-severity issue."
