    "author_summary": "The Code Author refuted most vulnerabilities: 1) Buffer Overflow is prevented by bounds checking `gif_bytes` before accessing `gif_data`. 2) Integer Overflow is unlikely due to constraints from the GIF specification. 3) Unchecked Return Values are acknowledged, with a proposal to add consistent checks. 4) Use of Uninitialized Memory is refuted as `frame_data` is checked for null after assignment. 5) Potential Null Pointer Dereference is refuted as the code checks `frame_data` for null, returning an error if it is null."
