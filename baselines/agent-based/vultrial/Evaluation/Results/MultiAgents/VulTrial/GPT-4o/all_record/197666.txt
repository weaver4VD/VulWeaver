        "reason": "The variables 'from', 'to', and 'length' are declared as int64_t, which is a 64-bit integer type. This provides a very large range of values, making it highly unlikely to encounter an overflow in practical scenarios. Additionally, the code logic ensures that these variables are used within the bounds of the data structures they index, further mitigating the risk of overflow."

To strengthen input validation, I propose adding explicit checks to ensure that 'from' and 'to' are within the valid range of indices for the data structures they are used with.

The code path where 'njs_value_property_i64' returns NJS_DECLINED does not use 'entry' without setting it to a valid value, thus preventing the use of uninitialized variables."
