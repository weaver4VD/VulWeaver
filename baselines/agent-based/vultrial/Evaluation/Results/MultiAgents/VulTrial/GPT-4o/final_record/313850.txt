        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential null pointer dereference is valid. The function does not check if `pp` and `lenp` are NULL before dereferencing them, which could lead to a segmentation fault. The Code Author's proposal to add checks is a necessary mitigation to prevent this issue."

        "justification": "While the Code Author argues that cursor positions are bounded by the text buffer size, the Security Researcher's concern about integer overflow is partially valid. Although the risk is minimal, it is prudent to ensure that all arithmetic operations are safe. Monitoring and reviewing the code for potential overflow scenarios is advisable."

        "justification": "The Code Author's refutation is valid. The function only calculates the length of the selected text and does not perform buffer operations directly. Therefore, the risk of buffer overflow in this function is unfounded, as bounds checking is handled elsewhere."

Ensuring that `mb_ptr2len` is correctly implemented and robust against edge cases is crucial to prevent potential data corruption or security issues."
