        "justification": "While `free(NULL)` is safe, the Code Author acknowledged the need for improved error handling when `digest_final` fails. The proposed mitigation to ensure `tmp` is only freed if allocated and to handle errors more robustly is a reasonable approach to prevent potential resource management issues."

The Code Author's agreement to add checks for these inputs is necessary to enhance the function's robustness and prevent potential security issues."
