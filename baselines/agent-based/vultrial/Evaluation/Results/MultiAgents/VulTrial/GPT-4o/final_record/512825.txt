    "justification": "The code author correctly refutes this vulnerability. The loop ensures that 'left_item' is assigned a valid value before it is used in 'left_item->build_clone(thd)'. If 'left_item' remains null, the function returns false, preventing any null pointer dereference."

The author's mitigation proposal to check the return value and handle errors is appropriate and should be implemented."

The author's suggestion to add cleanup code is necessary to prevent resource exhaustion and should be implemented."
