The check `(uint64)(2147483647/typesize)<target_count64` ensures that `datasize` will not exceed the maximum value that can be safely handled, thus preventing overflow."

        "justification": "The function `_TIFFCheckMalloc` is designed to return a null pointer if memory allocation fails, which is checked immediately after the call. The concern about `_TIFFCheckMalloc` returning a non-zero invalid pointer is unfounded, as the function adheres to standard memory allocation practices where a null return value indicates failure."

The checks `(uint64)(2147483647/typesize)<target_count64` and `(uint64)(2147483647/desttypesize)<target_count64` ensure that the sizes are within safe limits, effectively validating the type sizes."

Implementing checks to verify that these offsets do not point to unintended memory locations will enhance security and prevent potential exploitation."
