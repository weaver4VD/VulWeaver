The operations are within the bounds of typical integer sizes used in C programming, and there is no evidence of potential overflow in the given context."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about out-of-bounds access is valid, as the index 'w' is used to access 'big5_ucs_table' without explicit boundary checks. Although the code checks if 'w' is within 'big5_ucs_table_size', ensuring robust boundary checks is crucial to prevent undefined behavior. The Code Author's proposal to add explicit checks is a necessary mitigation."

These checks are designed to prevent invalid or unexpected values from being used, addressing the Security Researcher's concerns."

The loop iterating over 'cp950_pua_tbl' lacks a proper boundary check, which could lead to accessing memory beyond the intended limits if 'k' exceeds the array size. The Code Author's proposal to add a boundary check is necessary to prevent this vulnerability."
