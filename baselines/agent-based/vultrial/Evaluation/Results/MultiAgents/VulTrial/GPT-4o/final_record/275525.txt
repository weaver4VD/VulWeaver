        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about the lack of detailed error logging and recovery mechanisms is valid. The current implementation could lead to unhandled exceptions and make debugging difficult. The Code Author's proposal to enhance error logging and implement recovery strategies is a necessary step to address this issue."

        "severity": "none",
        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The Code Author correctly refutes the claim of a potential memory leak. The function includes calls to 'njs_async_context_free' in both normal and error paths, ensuring that memory is freed appropriately. The design effectively prevents memory leaks, making the Researcher's concern unfounded."

        "justification": "The lack of input validation is a significant security risk, as it could lead to buffer overflows or injection attacks. The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests adding input checks, which is crucial to prevent potential exploitation and ensure the function's security."

        "justification": "The Code Author's explanation that the variables are initialized with the current state of 'vm->levels' before use is accurate. This ensures that the pointers are properly set, and the concern about uninitialized variables is not applicable in this context."
