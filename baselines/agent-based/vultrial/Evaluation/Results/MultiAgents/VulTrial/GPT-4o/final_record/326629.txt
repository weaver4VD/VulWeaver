        "justification": "The Code Author correctly points out that the function returns 'ARCHIVE_OK' if 'open()' fails, which prevents any further operations with an invalid file descriptor. This effectively handles the error and avoids undefined behavior, making the Researcher's claim invalid."

If 'O_NOFOLLOW' is unsupported, 'open()' will fail, and the function will return 'ARCHIVE_OK', preventing insecure file handling.
