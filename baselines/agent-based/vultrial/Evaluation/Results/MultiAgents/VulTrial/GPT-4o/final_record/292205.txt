        "justification": "The use of `strcpy` without checking the length of `extensions_str` poses a significant risk of buffer overflow, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or a crash. The Code Author's suggestion to replace `strcpy` with safer alternatives like `strncpy` or `g_strlcpy` is appropriate and should be implemented immediately to mitigate this risk."

        "justification": "The lack of input validation for `extensions_str` is a valid concern. Without proper validation, malicious data could be processed, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues. Implementing input validation to sanitize and verify `extensions_str` is necessary to prevent potential command injection or other vulnerabilities."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "While `g_strlcat` is generally safer than `strcpy`, it still requires careful use with proper size checks. The concern is partially valid as the current implementation does not ensure that the total length of concatenated strings respects the buffer size. Replacing `strcpy` and ensuring all string operations are performed with size-aware functions is crucial."

        "justification": "Handling sensitive information like SASL passwords without proper input validation and buffer management can lead to information disclosure. The risk is valid, and the Code Author's suggestion to handle sensitive data securely, with encryption and restricted access, should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access or privilege escalation."
