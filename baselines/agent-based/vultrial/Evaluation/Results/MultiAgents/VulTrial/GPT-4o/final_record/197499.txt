        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified that several function calls do not have their return values checked, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The Code Author acknowledged this issue and proposed implementing comprehensive error checking, which is a necessary step to prevent potential security risks."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The potential for a null pointer dereference is a serious issue that could lead to application crashes. The Code Author agreed to add checks for null pointers, which is essential to prevent this vulnerability. Given the potential impact, this should be addressed immediately."

        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "While the Code Author refuted the claim by stating that the API includes proper memory management practices, the lack of clear documentation could lead to misunderstandings. Updating the documentation as proposed by the Code Author is a good step, but monitoring is recommended to ensure no memory management issues arise."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The lack of input validation when reading from a bitstream is a valid concern that could lead to buffer overflows or unexpected behavior. The Code Author's proposal to implement input validation checks is necessary to mitigate this risk."
