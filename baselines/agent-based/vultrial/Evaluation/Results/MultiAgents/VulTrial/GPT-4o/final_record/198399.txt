        "justification": "The buffer `addr` is defined with `INET_ADDRSTRLEN`, which is sufficient for any valid IPv4 address. The use of `sprintf` is safe in this context because the values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are expected to be within the range of 0-255, typical for IP address octets. Additionally, `inet_aton` ensures that only valid IP addresses are processed, mitigating the risk of buffer overflow."

This could result in undefined behavior when these variables are used. Checking the return value of `sscanf` to ensure that exactly six integers are parsed is necessary to prevent potential issues."

The maximum value for `ctrl->data_port` would be 65535, which is within the range of a 16-bit integer. Therefore, integer overflow is not a concern in this context."

This will prevent malformed input from being processed and ensure that only valid IP addresses and ports are used."
