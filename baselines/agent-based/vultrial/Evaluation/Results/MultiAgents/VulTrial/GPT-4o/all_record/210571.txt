        "reason": "The variables `default_rx_params` and `default_tx_params` are assumed to be initialized elsewhere in the codebase, as they are used as default parameters. This is a common practice in driver development where default configurations are predefined. The absence of explicit initialization in this function does not imply they are uninitialized globally. However, I will ensure that these variables are properly initialized in the relevant part of the codebase to prevent any potential issues."

If an error is detected, the function will return an appropriate error code and perform necessary cleanup actions, such as freeing allocated resources, to maintain system stability."

However, to address the concern of potential information leaks, I will ensure that `dev->name` is properly validated and sanitized before use. Additionally, I will review the buffer size to ensure it is sufficient to hold the formatted string, thus preventing any unintended information disclosure."
