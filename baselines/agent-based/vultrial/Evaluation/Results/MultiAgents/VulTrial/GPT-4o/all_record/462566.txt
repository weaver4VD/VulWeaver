    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified three main vulnerabilities: (1) Command Injection due to constructing command line strings with user inputs, which could allow arbitrary command execution if inputs are manipulated. (2) Improper Input Sanitization, as replacing single quotes with '%27' is insufficient to prevent command injection, leaving other dangerous characters unaddressed. (3) Use of System Shell for Command Execution, which increases the risk of command injection as the shell interprets command strings, potentially allowing exploitation.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledges the vulnerabilities and proposes mitigations: (1) For Command Injection, using parameterized commands or libraries that handle execution without a shell, like `execvp`. (2) For Improper Input Sanitization, implementing robust validation to escape or reject dangerous characters. (3) For Use of System Shell, refactoring to avoid shell usage by directly executing commands with system calls that do not involve a shell."
