Any mode misconfiguration is a higher-level logic error outside the scope of this function. The function's behavior is intentional and prevents misuse in inappropriate contexts."

        "justification": "The lack of input validation for `keyid` could lead to security issues such as buffer overflows or injection attacks. The Code Author agrees with the need for input validation to ensure robustness against malformed or malicious input. Implementing a validation step is necessary to mitigate these risks."

The Code Author acknowledges this issue and suggests implementing a function to clear the recipients list when it is no longer needed. Addressing this will prevent resource exhaustion and potential denial of service attacks."
