        "justification": "The code author correctly pointed out that the function checks if 'actx' is NULL after attempting to allocate memory with OPENSSL_zalloc. If the allocation fails, the function returns 0 immediately, preventing any further operations on 'actx' and thus avoiding a null pointer dereference."

        "justification": "The code author accurately noted that the code checks if 'actx' is non-NULL before proceeding with the memory duplication using OPENSSL_memdup. If 'actx' is NULL, the code does not attempt to duplicate it, thus avoiding undefined behavior."
