        "justification": "The function `n_start_visual_mode` is intended for internal use within the application, where the input `c` is controlled and validated by the calling functions. It is not exposed to external input directly, and the values for `c` are predefined control characters for visual modes. Therefore, the risk of malicious input is mitigated."

        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The integer `c` is used to represent specific control characters for visual modes, which are well within the bounds of typical integer values. There are no arithmetic operations on `c` that could lead to overflow, and the context ensures it is within a safe range."

        "justification": "While the use of `#ifdef` directives can lead to different code paths, this is a common practice to enable or disable features based on compilation configurations. The risk is mitigated by thorough testing across all configurations. However, it is important to continue monitoring and testing to ensure no vulnerabilities are introduced in less common configurations."

        "justification": "The variable `cursor_line_was_concealed` is conditionally defined and used only within the scope of the `#ifdef FEAT_CONCEAL` directive. This ensures it is only compiled and used when the feature is enabled, preventing any risk of uninitialized usage. The code structure guarantees that the variable is not accessed outside of its defined scope."
