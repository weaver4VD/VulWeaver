        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern is valid as the code does not adequately check the combined length of `dir` and `info->name` against `NJS_MAX_PATH`, which could lead to a buffer overflow. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a crash, making it a high-severity issue that needs immediate attention."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The potential for path traversal is a legitimate concern. The function uses user-controlled inputs to construct file paths without proper validation, which could allow an attacker to access unauthorized files. Although `realpath` helps mitigate this risk, input validation is still necessary to prevent directory traversal attacks. This makes it a medium-severity issue that should be addressed promptly."

        "decision": "valid",

        "justification": "The lack of detailed error handling is a valid concern. While it does not directly lead to a security breach, it can hinder diagnosing issues and detecting unauthorized access attempts. Logging detailed error messages would improve security monitoring and diagnosis, making it a low-severity issue that should be monitored and improved over time."
