The code immediately checks if ctx is nullptr and returns an error if it is, preventing any further operations on a null pointer. Therefore, there is no risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this implementation."

The function does not validate the node parameter, which could lead to undefined behavior if node is invalid or maliciously crafted. The Code Author acknowledges this issue and suggests adding a validation step to ensure the node parameter is not null and is properly initialized. This validation is necessary to prevent potential exploitation or application crashes."
