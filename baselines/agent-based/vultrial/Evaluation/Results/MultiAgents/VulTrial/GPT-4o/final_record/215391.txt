        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The current implementation correctly sizes the buffer for the string it holds, and the use of `sizeof` ensures that no buffer overflow occurs. However, the concern about future changes is valid. If the error message is modified without adjusting the buffer size, it could introduce a vulnerability. While this is a standard maintenance issue, it is important to monitor changes to ensure the buffer remains appropriately sized."

        "severity": "none",
        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The hardcoded error message is generic and does not contain sensitive information. It is used internally to indicate a parameter length violation, which is a common error condition. There is no evidence that this message leads to information leakage or poses a security risk. The use of a static message ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors, aligning with best practices for error handling."
