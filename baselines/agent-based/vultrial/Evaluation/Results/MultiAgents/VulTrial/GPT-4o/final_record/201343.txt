        "justification": "The function `selinux_ptrace_traceme` correctly uses `avc_has_perm` to enforce access control based on SELinux policies. The potential for unauthorized access arises from policy misconfiguration, which is outside the scope of the function's implementation. The function itself is not flawed, and the responsibility for correct policy configuration lies with system administrators."

        "justification": "The function currently lacks error handling, which could obscure issues if `avc_has_perm` fails. While this does not directly lead to a security vulnerability, it can hinder troubleshooting and system maintenance. Implementing logging and handling specific error codes would improve system robustness and visibility into potential issues."
