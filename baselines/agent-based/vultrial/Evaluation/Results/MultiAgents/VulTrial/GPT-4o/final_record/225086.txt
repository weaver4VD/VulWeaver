This could lead to incorrect behavior if the function relies on unique attribute names for correct operation. The Code Author's proposal to throw an exception or return an error code is a valid mitigation strategy, as it would ensure that the caller is informed of the issue and can handle it appropriately."

    "justification": "The lack of error handling beyond logging is a valid concern, as it could lead to incorrect application behavior if the caller assumes the function executed correctly. The Code Author's suggestion to modify the function to throw an exception or return a boolean status is a reasonable approach to ensure that errors are communicated to the caller, allowing for appropriate handling and maintaining robust application logic."
