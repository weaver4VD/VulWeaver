        "justification": "While the casting away of the const qualifier is intentional and necessary for specific operations, it could lead to undefined behavior if not properly managed. The Code Author's suggestion to add checks and documentation is a reasonable mitigation strategy."

The Code Author's plan to review and potentially enhance the locking strategy is appropriate."
