    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Random Number Generation",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The use of GuardedPhiloxRandom is appropriate for the context of generating sequences for pooling operations in machine learning. The predictability of the sequence does not compromise the security of the application as it is not used for cryptographic purposes. The seeds are expected to be provided securely, and the randomness is sufficient for its intended use."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Integer Overflow",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the typical use case involves dimensions that are within the safe range for int, there is a potential risk of overflow with extremely large values. Switching to int64_t for calculations is a prudent measure to ensure safety, but the current risk is low given the expected input sizes in practical scenarios."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Array Indexing",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code's logic inherently prevents out-of-bounds access by carefully constructing the height_cum_seq and width_cum_seq vectors and iterating over their sizes minus one. This is a common and safe practice, and the design ensures indices are within bounds."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Lack of Input Validation",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The code includes basic validation checks, but additional validation is necessary to ensure all input dimensions and pooling ratios are positive and within expected ranges. This will prevent potential exploitation through malicious inputs, which could lead to incorrect computations or crashes."
