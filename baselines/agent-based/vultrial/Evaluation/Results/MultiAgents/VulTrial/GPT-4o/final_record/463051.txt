Without checks, there is a potential for buffer overflow or memory corruption, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or crash the application. The Code Author's acknowledgment and proposed mitigation align with best practices for securing input handling."

If `size` is not properly validated, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The Code Author's plan to validate the range of `size` is a necessary step to prevent such issues."

Without error checks, the application could become unstable or crash, leading to a denial of service. The Code Author's proposal to implement error handling is essential to ensure the application's stability and security."
