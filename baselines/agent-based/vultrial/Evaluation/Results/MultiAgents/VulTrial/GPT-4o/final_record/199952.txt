        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The use of fixed-size buffers without proper bounds checking when reading data from the file can lead to buffer overflow, which is a critical security vulnerability. This can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the application."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code allocates memory dynamically but does not ensure all allocated memory is deallocated in case of early returns due to errors. This can lead to memory leaks, which can exhaust system resources over time."

        "justification": "Functions like `f.read()` and `f.readDwords()` are called without checking their return values, which can lead to processing incomplete or corrupted data. This can cause undefined behavior or crashes."
