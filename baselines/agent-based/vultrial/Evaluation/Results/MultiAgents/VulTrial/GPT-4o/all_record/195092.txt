  "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified three main vulnerabilities: (1) Null Pointer Dereference, where the function may return nullptr if no cases match, potentially leading to crashes if not handled by the caller. (2) Unreachable Code, due to the use of llvm_unreachable, which assumes all operand kinds are handled, risking undefined behavior if new kinds are added. (3) Improper Handling of Unexpected Operand Kinds, where the default case does not manage unexpected kinds, possibly resulting in nullptr returns and undefined behavior.",
  "author_summary": "The Code Author proposed mitigations for each vulnerability: (1) For Null Pointer Dereference, adding a default case to return an error literal or log a message to inform the caller. (2) For Unreachable Code, using static assertions or a comprehensive test suite to ensure all operand kinds are handled and updating the code as needed. (3) For Improper Handling of Unexpected Operand Kinds, implementing a default case to return an error literal or log a message, ensuring the caller is aware of unexpected kinds."
