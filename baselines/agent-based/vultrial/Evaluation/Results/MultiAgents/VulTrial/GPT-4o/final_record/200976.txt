        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern is valid as dereferencing NULL pointers can lead to crashes or undefined behavior. The Code Author agrees and suggests adding checks to prevent this issue. Given the potential for a denial of service or other severe impacts, this should be addressed immediately."

        "justification": "While the Security Researcher raises a valid point about potential integer overflow, the Code Author's argument about the minimal likelihood in a text editor context is reasonable. However, implementing checks as a precautionary measure is advisable. The risk is low, but monitoring and adding checks can prevent future issues."

        "justification": "Handling multibyte characters is crucial, and the Security Researcher's concern about potential buffer issues is valid. The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests enhancing validation. Given the potential for buffer overflows, this should be addressed promptly to ensure robust handling of multibyte characters."
