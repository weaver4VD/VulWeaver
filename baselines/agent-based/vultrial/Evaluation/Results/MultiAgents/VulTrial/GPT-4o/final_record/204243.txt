        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "While the 'eval7' function is used in a controlled environment, the nature of evaluating expressions can still pose risks if the input is not adequately sanitized. The function does not directly execute arbitrary code, but the potential for misuse exists if the surrounding code does not enforce strict input validation."

        "justification": "The functions involved in memory management are part of a well-tested library with boundary checks. The risk of buffer overflow is minimal given the existing safeguards, and no evidence of improper handling was found in the provided code."
