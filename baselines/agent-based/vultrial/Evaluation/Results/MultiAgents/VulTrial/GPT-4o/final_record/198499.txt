        "decision": "invalid",
        "severity": "none",
        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The use of static memory allocation is intentional and appropriate for the cryptographic context, where the size of 'uECC_MAX_WORDS' is determined by fixed curve parameters. This ensures predictable stack usage, avoiding the risks associated with dynamic memory allocation."

        "vulnerability": "Lack of RNG Function Check",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The absence of a mandatory check for a secure RNG function poses a significant security risk, as cryptographic operations require randomness to prevent side-channel attacks. The author's proposal to enforce a secure RNG function is necessary to ensure cryptographic integrity."

        "decision": "partially valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "While the code attempts to mitigate side-channel attacks using random numbers, the effectiveness depends on the RNG's quality. The author's suggestion to integrate a vetted cryptographic library for RNG is a prudent step to enhance security, but the current implementation is not entirely insecure."

        "decision": "invalid",
        "severity": "none",
        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The code handles endianness through conditional compilation and platform-specific functions, ensuring correct behavior across architectures. The use of 'bcopy' and byte manipulation is standard practice in cryptographic implementations."
