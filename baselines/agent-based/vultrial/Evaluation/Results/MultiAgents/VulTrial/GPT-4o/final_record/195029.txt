    "vulnerability": "Use of unchecked dynamic memory allocation",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The allocation of `no_type` is intentional and designed to be a static allocation that persists for the lifetime of the application. Modern C++ environments handle allocation failures by throwing exceptions, which can be caught and managed. Therefore, the risk of a null pointer dereference is minimal and does not constitute a vulnerability."

    "vulnerability": "Potential memory leak",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The `no_type` variable is intended to be a static object that is allocated once and reused throughout the application's lifetime. This design choice is deliberate to avoid the overhead of repeated allocations and deallocations, and it is not considered a memory leak in this context."

    "vulnerability": "Unchecked return value from `ValueOrDie()`",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The use of `ValueOrDie()` without checking for errors can lead to undefined behavior if `infer_type` is an error. Replacing it with a safer alternative that checks for errors, such as using `StatusOr`, would enhance robustness and prevent potential application crashes."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Potential null pointer dereference",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The initial check for `props_->fwd_type_fn` being null is sufficient given the current design, where `props_` is expected to remain unchanged during the execution of `RunForwardTypeInference()`. Concerns about concurrent modification should be addressed at a higher architectural level."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Lack of thread safety",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "high",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The code does not include explicit synchronization mechanisms, which could lead to race conditions if `RunForwardTypeInference()` is called concurrently. Introducing mutexes or other synchronization primitives would ensure thread-safe access to shared data, addressing potential race conditions and maintaining application integrity."
