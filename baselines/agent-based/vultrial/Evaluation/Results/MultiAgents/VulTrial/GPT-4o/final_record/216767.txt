The function `uni_utf8_get_char_n` is designed to handle invalid UTF-8 sequences by returning a negative value, which is immediately checked.

        "justification": "The Code Author correctly points out that the code checks the return value of `uni_utf8_get_char_n`. If a negative value is returned, indicating an invalid UTF-8 sequence, the function logs an error and exits immediately, thus effectively mitigating the risk of processing malicious input."

        "justification": "The Code Author's explanation is accurate. The calculation `(uoff_t)(p - parser->cur)` is performed in a context where `p` is always greater than or equal to `parser->cur`, as `p` is incremented from `parser->cur` towards `parser->end`. Therefore, there is no risk of integer overflow in this calculation, and the size check against `max_size` is valid and secure."

        "justification": "The Code Author acknowledges the potential issue with handling entirely white space input and suggests a mitigation. While the current implementation trims trailing white space, adding a check to ensure the command is not empty after trimming would enhance robustness and prevent unexpected behavior. This is a minor issue but worth monitoring."
