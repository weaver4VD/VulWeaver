This mitigation aligns with best practices for preventing buffer overflows, and the Security Researcher's concern is addressed by the existing code logic."

        "justification": "While the code uses `PJ_MIN` to limit the length of the reason string, it does not explicitly validate the packet's content before determining the length. The Code Author acknowledges this and suggests adding a validation step. Although the current implementation mitigates the risk of buffer overflow, adding input validation would enhance security by ensuring the length value is within expected bounds, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior from crafted packets."
