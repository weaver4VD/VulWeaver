  {
    "vulnerability": "Blocking Operation",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The presence of a TODO comment indicates awareness of a potential blocking operation, which could lead to performance issues or be exploited in a denial-of-service attack. Addressing this by implementing asynchronous handling or non-blocking alternatives is necessary to ensure system responsiveness."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Null Pointer Dereference",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code includes checks to prevent null pointer dereference by using a ternary operator to default to `cpu_device` if `device` is null. This effectively mitigates the risk, making the vulnerability claim invalid."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Improper Error Handling",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While `TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR` is a standard practice, the lack of detailed logging could hinder diagnostics. Enhancing logging to capture error details securely would improve troubleshooting without exposing sensitive information. This is a minor issue but worth monitoring."

    "vulnerability": "Potential Information Disclosure",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The specific error message 'Empty resource handle' could disclose internal state information. Generalizing error messages to avoid revealing internal details while maintaining useful feedback is necessary to prevent information disclosure."
