    "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential integer overflow is valid. The current implementation lacks a check for integer overflow when calculating 'sparse_map_size'. This could lead to insufficient memory allocation, which is a significant risk. The Code Author's suggestion to add a check is a necessary mitigation."

The Code Author's proposed mitigation to check the allocation result and handle errors is appropriate and should be implemented."
