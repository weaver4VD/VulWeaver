    "justification": "The Code Author's refutation is valid. The code includes a null check immediately after the `GetContext(node)` call. If `ctx` is null, the function returns an error status, preventing any further operations on a null pointer. This effectively mitigates the risk of a null pointer dereference, as the line `ctx->set_output(output_port, shape)` is only executed if `ctx` is not null. Therefore, the Security Researcher's concern is unfounded in this context."
