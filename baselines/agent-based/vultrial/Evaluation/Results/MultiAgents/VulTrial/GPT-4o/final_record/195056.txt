    "vulnerability": "Buffer Overflow",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "The function assumes that input arrays are correctly sized and aligned, with `TFLITE_DCHECK_EQ` serving as a debug assertion to ensure `array_size` is a multiple of `bias_size`. However, this check is only active in debug builds and does not prevent misuse in production. While the application logic is expected to handle validation, the lack of explicit bounds checking in the function itself could still pose a risk if assumptions are violated."

    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The function relies on the application logic to ensure that `array_size` and `bias_size` are within safe bounds. Given the context of performance-critical code, this is a reasonable assumption, and the pointer arithmetic used is standard and safe under these conditions. The risk of integer overflow is minimal in this controlled environment."

    "vulnerability": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The `TFLITE_DCHECK_EQ` assertion ensures that `array_size` is a multiple of `bias_size`, preventing infinite loops or unexpected behavior during development. In production, the application logic is responsible for maintaining this precondition, making the risk of DoS negligible."

    "vulnerability": "Lack of Input Validation",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While input validation is expected to be handled at a higher level to avoid performance overhead, the lack of explicit validation within the function could lead to issues if the assumptions about input integrity are violated. This is a common trade-off in high-performance code, but it warrants monitoring to ensure that inputs remain well-formed."
