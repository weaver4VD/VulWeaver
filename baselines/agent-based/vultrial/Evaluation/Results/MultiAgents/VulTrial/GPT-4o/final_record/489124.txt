Since it is read-only, it does not pose a risk of data races or undefined behavior in multi-threaded environments. The Code Author's refutation is valid, as the use of a static buffer in this context is safe and efficient."

        "justification": "The function does not perform validation on its input parameters, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes if null or invalid pointers are passed. The Code Author acknowledges this issue and proposes adding checks to ensure robustness. Implementing these checks is crucial to prevent potential denial of service attacks and enhance the function's resilience against invalid inputs."
