        "justification": "The Code Author's explanation that memory allocation is controlled and documented is reasonable, but it relies on the assumption that the caller manages `*count` correctly. While the static nature of `auth_count` reduces risk, the potential for misuse by the caller warrants caution. Monitoring and clear documentation are necessary to prevent misuse."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Code Author acknowledges the lack of null checks and agrees to add them. This is a valid concern as dereferencing null pointers can lead to application crashes, making it important to address this issue promptly."

        "justification": "The Code Author's assumption that input validation occurs earlier is common, but the principle of defense-in-depth suggests that additional validation could be beneficial. While not critical in this function, reviewing the input validation process can enhance overall security."
