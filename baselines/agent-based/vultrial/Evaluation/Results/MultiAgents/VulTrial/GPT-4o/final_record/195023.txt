[
  {
    "vulnerability": "Integer Overflow",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The code includes a mechanism to detect and handle integer overflow by checking the `overflow_ocurred` flag. If an overflow is detected, the operation is halted with an error message, effectively preventing any incorrect calculations or memory issues. Therefore, the vulnerability is not present."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Input Indices",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The code currently only checks the shape of the input indices but does not validate the actual content for out-of-bounds values. This could lead to undefined behavior if indices are out of range. Implementing additional checks to ensure indices are within valid bounds is necessary to prevent potential memory corruption or unauthorized access."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability": "Unchecked Input Values",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the code assumes that input values are validated elsewhere, this assumption may not always hold true. Although the risk is lower if the data is from a trusted source, it is advisable to ensure that input values are validated at some point in the data pipeline to prevent incorrect computations or security issues."
  },
  {
    "vulnerability": "Potential Denial of Service via Large Input",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "high",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The code does not impose any limits on the size of input tensors, which could lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service if very large inputs are provided. Implementing size checks to limit the maximum allowable size of input tensors is crucial to prevent excessive memory usage and ensure application stability."
