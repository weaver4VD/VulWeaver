        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The lack of input validation for 'sampleSize' and 'numRecords' is a valid concern. Although the function may assume these values are from trusted sources, adding validation checks is a standard security practice to prevent potential resource exhaustion or denial of service attacks."

        "decision": "valid",

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The potential for integer overflow in arithmetic operations involving 'sampleSize', 'numRecords', and 'gTimeseriesBucketMaxCount' is a valid concern. Introducing checks to ensure these values are within safe limits before performing operations is necessary to prevent overflow and maintain correct logic execution."

        "justification": "The static constants 'kMaxSampleRatioForRandCursor' and 'kCoefficient' are used for performance tuning based on empirical data. They are not security parameters, and their use does not inherently pose a security risk. Adjustments can be made if data size or distribution assumptions change, but this does not constitute a security vulnerability."

        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "While the function does return a pair with a nullptr and false without logging, which could lead to silent failures, this is more of a robustness issue than a direct security vulnerability. Adding logging mechanisms would improve error handling and ensure issues are recorded for prompt addressing."

        "severity": "none",
        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The use of a random cursor is a deliberate design choice to optimize sampling performance. The function ensures that the cursor is used within the constraints of the collection's sharding and ownership filters, preventing unauthorized data access. The security implications are considered, and the design ensures that only authorized data is accessed."
