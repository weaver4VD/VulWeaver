        "justification": "The recursion limit is set to 1000, which is a reasonable safeguard against stack overflow. However, if an attacker can craft input to reach this limit, it could still lead to a denial of service. The Code Author's suggestion to implement additional checks and explore iterative approaches is a prudent mitigation strategy."

        "justification": "While the function does not use traditional 'eval' functionality, it does evaluate expressions dynamically. This can be risky if inputs are not properly sanitized. The Code Author acknowledges the need for input sanitization, which is crucial to prevent potential code injection vulnerabilities."
