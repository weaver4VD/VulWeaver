    "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern is valid as the function does not free the memory allocated by `dupstr` for each string in `result`. This can lead to memory leaks if the caller does not handle it properly. The Code Author's suggestion to document this requirement is helpful, but the function should ideally manage its own memory to prevent misuse."
