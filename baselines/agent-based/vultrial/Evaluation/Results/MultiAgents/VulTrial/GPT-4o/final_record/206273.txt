        "justification": "The use of `strdup` is safe in this context as it duplicates the entire string, including the null terminator, into a newly allocated memory block. The concern about buffer overflow is unfounded because `strdup` handles the memory allocation internally and ensures the string is properly terminated."

        "justification": "The variable `addr` is conditionally assigned a value based on the logic flow of the function. If `ptr` is not zero, the code path ensures that `addr` is assigned a valid value before it is used. The code logic prevents the use of an uninitialized variable, making this concern inapplicable."

The Code Author acknowledged this issue and proposed a valid mitigation by adding `free(esil_buf);` before each return statement where `esil_buf` is no longer needed."

        "justification": "The arithmetic operations on `ptr` and `frame_off` are performed with checks in place to ensure they do not exceed the maximum stack frame size, which is a defined constant. The logic ensures that any potential overflow is caught by these checks, making the concern about integer overflow unfounded."

        "justification": "The functions `strstr` and `strncmp` are used with the assumption that the strings are null-terminated, as they are derived from controlled sources within the program. The code ensures that these strings are properly terminated before use, thus preventing buffer over-reads."
