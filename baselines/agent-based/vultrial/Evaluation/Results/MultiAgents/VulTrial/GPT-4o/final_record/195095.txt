        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The use of `SSLv23_client_method()` is indeed for compatibility with older OpenSSL versions, and it negotiates the highest available protocol version. However, the naming can be misleading, and there is a risk if the configuration allows older protocols. Monitoring and ensuring that insecure protocols are disabled is advisable."

        "vulnerability": "Lack of Certificate Validation",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code sets up certificate verification parameters but does not enforce strict validation policies or use a verification callback. This could lead to accepting invalid certificates, posing a significant security risk. Implementing a custom verification callback is necessary to ensure robust certificate validation."

        "vulnerability": "Improper Error Handling",
        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The current error handling approach focuses on logging, which may expose sensitive information and lacks secure recovery mechanisms. Enhancing error handling to sanitize logs and implement recovery strategies is crucial to prevent information disclosure and maintain application stability."

        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The code correctly frees the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM` object, and the comment reflects caution rather than a flaw. There is no evidence of a memory leak in the current implementation."
