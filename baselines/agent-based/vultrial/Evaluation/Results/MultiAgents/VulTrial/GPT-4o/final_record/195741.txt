  {
    "vulnerability": "Lack of Error Handling",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "high",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The absence of error handling in critical operations like `BeginReadMCU` and `GolombDecode` can lead to undefined behavior or crashes, which are serious issues in a production environment. The Code Author's acknowledgment and proposal to implement error handling confirm the validity of this vulnerability."

    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "While the potential for integer overflow exists, the specific impact depends on the context and input data. The Code Author's plan to add checks and use larger data types is a reasonable mitigation strategy. Monitoring is recommended to ensure these changes are effective."

    "severity": "high",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "Unchecked array access can lead to severe security issues like memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. The Code Author's agreement to implement bounds checking supports the need for immediate action to address this vulnerability."

    "vulnerability": "Use of Assert for Runtime Checks",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "Using `assert` for runtime checks is problematic in production builds where assertions are disabled, potentially allowing invalid states to go undetected. The Code Author's proposal to replace `assert` with runtime checks is necessary to maintain robustness and security."
