        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The code includes a check to ensure that the sum of 'length' and 'delta' does not exceed 'NJS_MAX_LENGTH'. This effectively prevents integer overflow, as the check ensures the resulting length of the array does not surpass the maximum allowable length."

        "recommended_action": "implement enhanced error handling",
        "justification": "While the code does check for memory allocation failure by returning an error code when 'njs_array_alloc' returns NULL, the handling could be improved with additional logging and descriptive error messages to aid in diagnosing and addressing the issue more effectively."
