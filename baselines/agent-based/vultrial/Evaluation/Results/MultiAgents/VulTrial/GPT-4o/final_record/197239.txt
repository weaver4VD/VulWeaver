    "justification": "The use of C-style casts can indeed lead to undefined behavior and potential memory issues. The Code Author's suggestion to use C++ static_cast or reinterpret_cast is a valid mitigation strategy that should be implemented to enhance type safety and prevent potential vulnerabilities."

    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",

    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The operations in question are performed using floating-point arithmetic, which inherently avoids integer overflow. The Code Author's explanation is accurate, and the concern raised by the Security Researcher does not apply in this context."

However, the existing handling is not entirely inadequate, so this is a low-severity issue that should be monitored and improved as suggested."
