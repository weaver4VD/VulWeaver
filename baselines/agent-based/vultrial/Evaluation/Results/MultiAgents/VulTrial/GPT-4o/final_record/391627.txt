The function includes a check to ensure that `nbytes` is less than `MAX_DRC_NAME_LEN` before proceeding, which prevents any buffer overflow. The use of `strscpy` with `nbytes + 1` is safe in this context because the initial check ensures that the buffer will not be overrun."

        "justification": "The function does not explicitly check for a null terminator within the first `nbytes` characters of `buf`, which could lead to undefined behavior if `buf` is not properly null-terminated. This could be exploited to cause unexpected behavior, so it is important to implement the proposed mitigation strategy to ensure robust input validation."
