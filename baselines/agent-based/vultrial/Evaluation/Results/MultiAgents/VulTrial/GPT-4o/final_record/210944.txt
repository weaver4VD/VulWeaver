        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The recursive function call limit can indeed be bypassed if `p_mfd` is set higher than 200, which could lead to a stack overflow. However, this requires specific configuration changes, so it is not immediately exploitable without user intervention. Monitoring and setting a hard limit on recursion depth would mitigate this risk."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "Using the function pointer `fgetline` without validation poses a significant risk of arbitrary code execution if an attacker can influence its value. This is a critical security issue that should be addressed by adding checks to ensure the pointer is valid before use."

        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "While there are mechanisms to free allocated memory, ensuring all paths, especially error paths, properly free memory is crucial. The risk is low but should be monitored to prevent potential memory leaks over time."
