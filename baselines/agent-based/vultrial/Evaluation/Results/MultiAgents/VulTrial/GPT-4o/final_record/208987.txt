The Code Author's proposed mitigation to rearrange the code to delete 'mixer' only after all operations are completed is appropriate and should be implemented immediately to prevent potential arbitrary code execution."

The Code Author's suggestion to set pointers to nullptr after deletion is a standard practice to prevent such issues and should be implemented to ensure memory safety."

The Code Author's proposal to add null checks before accessing 'mixer' methods is a necessary step to prevent potential crashes due to null pointer dereference, ensuring the stability of the application."
