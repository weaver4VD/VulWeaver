    "justification": "The function `skb_pull` is a pointer adjustment function that does not return a value, and its operation is based on the assumption that the buffer is sufficiently large, as ensured by the initial allocation with `dev_alloc_skb`. The concern of undefined behavior due to unchecked return value is unfounded, as `skb_pull` does not fail under normal circumstances."

    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The potential memory leak is a valid concern. If `rsi_prepare_beacon` fails, the allocated `skb` is not freed, leading to a memory leak. The Code Author's proposal to use `dev_kfree_skb` to free the memory is a suitable mitigation to prevent resource exhaustion and should be implemented immediately."

    "vulnerability": "Improper Memory Alignment Handling",
    "decision": "invalid",
    "severity": "none",
    "recommended_action": "no action needed",
    "justification": "The alignment logic is correctly implemented, and the buffer size is predetermined by `MAX_MGMT_PKT_SIZE`, which is designed to accommodate such adjustments. The assumption that `skb_pull` may fail is incorrect, as it is a pointer adjustment function that does not fail under the given conditions. Therefore, the concern about improper memory alignment handling is not applicable."
