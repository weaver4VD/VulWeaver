        "justification": "The Code Author correctly pointed out that the function checks if 'movie->moov' is null at the beginning and returns immediately if it is, preventing any null pointer dereference. The Security Researcher's claim does not hold in this context."

        "justification": "The function allocates memory for 'writer' but does not free it if subsequent allocations fail, leading to a memory leak. The Code Author acknowledged this and proposed a valid mitigation strategy. This issue should be addressed to prevent potential memory exhaustion."
