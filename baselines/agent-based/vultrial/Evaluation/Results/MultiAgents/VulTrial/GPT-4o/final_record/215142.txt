        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "Hardcoding certificates is a well-known security risk as it can lead to exposure and misuse, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. The Code Author's proposal to implement a secure certificate management system is a necessary step to mitigate this risk."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "Using a dummy policy in a security context is inadequate and can lead to severe security breaches. The Code Author's plan to replace it with a robust security policy is essential to ensure strong encryption and authentication."

        "justification": "While default configurations can be insecure, the actual risk depends on the specific settings of 'UA_ConnectionConfig_default'. The Code Author's intention to review and customize these settings is prudent, but the severity is medium until a specific vulnerability is confirmed."

        "justification": "The absence of error handling can lead to undetected failures, which is a significant security concern. Implementing error handling is crucial to ensure the system does not operate in an insecure state."
