        "justification": "The Code Author correctly identified that the code includes a check to ensure 'dire->size' is never greater than or equal to 'SQUASHFS_NAME_LEN'. This check prevents any buffer overflow from occurring, as the function exits if the condition is met."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher and Code Author both agree that the 'realloc' return value is not properly handled. Assigning the result of 'realloc' to a temporary pointer before updating 'dir->dirs' is necessary to prevent potential memory leaks or use of NULL pointers."
