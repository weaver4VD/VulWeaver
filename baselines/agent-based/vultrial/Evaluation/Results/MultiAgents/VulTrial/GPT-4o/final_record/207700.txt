    "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified that the code lacks proper error handling when an 'id' is not found in the map. The Code Author also acknowledges this issue and suggests a mitigation strategy. The absence of error handling can lead to undefined behavior or crashes, which are critical issues that need immediate attention to ensure application stability."

    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "The Security Researcher points out a potential information disclosure risk due to logging. The Code Author proposes restricting log access and making messages more generic. While the risk exists, it largely depends on the logging configuration and access controls in place. Therefore, it is partially valid and should be monitored to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized users."
