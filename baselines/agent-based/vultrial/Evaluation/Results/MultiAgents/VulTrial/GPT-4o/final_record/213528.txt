        "justification": "The function `fs_parse` is designed to return either a valid option or a negative error code. The code correctly handles negative return values immediately, and the switch statement is structured to handle all valid options. Therefore, there is no risk of undefined behavior from unhandled options, as the Code Author correctly refuted."

        "justification": "While the current logic assumes `param->string` is valid, adding a NULL check before assignment is a prudent measure to prevent potential null pointer dereference. The Code Author's suggestion to add a check is a reasonable mitigation strategy, acknowledging the potential risk."
