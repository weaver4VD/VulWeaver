    "vulnerability": "Lack of Input Validation",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "high",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential directory traversal or injection attacks is valid. The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy acknowledges the risk and suggests a reasonable approach to address it. Given the potential for unauthorized file deletions, this vulnerability is severe and should be addressed promptly."

    "vulnerability": "Improper Error Handling",
    "decision": "valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The lack of error handling for critical operations like `ha_close()` and `maria_delete_table_files()` can lead to undetected failures and inconsistent states. The Code Author's acknowledgment and proposed mitigation indicate that this is a recognized issue. Proper error handling is essential to maintain system integrity, so this should be fixed immediately."

  {
    "vulnerability": "Assumption of Temporary Table",
    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "low",
    "recommended_action": "monitor",
    "justification": "The Code Author's explanation that the assertion is a deliberate design choice for development is reasonable. However, the risk of logic errors or bugs elsewhere in the code that could lead to non-temporary tables being passed cannot be entirely dismissed. While the risk is low, it is advisable to monitor this aspect and ensure that additional checks are in place in production environments."
