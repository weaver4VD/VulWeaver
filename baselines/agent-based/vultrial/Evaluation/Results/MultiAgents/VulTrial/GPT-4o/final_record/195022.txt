    "justification": "Hardcoding session expiration can lead to predictable session lifetimes, increasing the risk of session hijacking. The Code Author's proposal to make this configurable is a valid mitigation strategy."

    "justification": "While the buffer size is close to the limit, the risk of overflow is low if the date format remains consistent. However, adjusting the buffer size and adding checks is a prudent measure to prevent potential issues."
