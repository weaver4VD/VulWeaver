        "justification": "The code includes a check to ensure that 'size' is not greater than 'r_size(op1)', which effectively prevents buffer overflow by bounding the pointer arithmetic. This check ensures that the pattern size does not exceed the size of the string being searched, thus preventing access beyond allocated memory."

        "justification": "The pointer arithmetic is controlled by the 'count' variable, which is calculated as the difference between 'r_size(op1)' and 'size'. This ensures that the pointers 'ptr' and 'pat' remain within valid memory bounds during the search operation, preventing access to invalid memory locations."

        "justification": "The function uses 'check_read_type' to verify that both 'op1' and 'op' are of type 't_string' before proceeding with operations. This ensures that the inputs are valid strings, and the size checks further validate that the sizes are appropriate for the operations being performed."

        "justification": "While the function assumes that 'op1' and 'op' are valid pointers, adding explicit null checks would enhance robustness and prevent potential null pointer dereference. This is a good practice to prevent crashes, although the current context may ensure that these pointers are valid."
