        "justification": "The return value of `read_authkey` is checked immediately after its invocation. If it fails, the function exits via a `goto` statement, preventing further execution. The Security Researcher's concern about proceeding with an uninitialized or incorrect authentication key is unfounded."

        "justification": "While `goto` statements can complicate maintenance, they are used here for centralized cleanup, which is a valid pattern. However, refactoring to structured error handling could improve maintainability. The current implementation does not pose an immediate security risk but should be monitored for future improvements."

However, if `find_site_by_name` fails, `local` may remain uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior. Initializing `local` to a safe default and adding checks is necessary to prevent potential issues."
