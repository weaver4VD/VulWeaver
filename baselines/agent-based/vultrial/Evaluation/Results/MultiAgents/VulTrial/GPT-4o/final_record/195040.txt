    "justification": "The use of raw pointers for managing the `XlaCompilationCache` object is a valid concern as it can lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. The Code Author's suggestion to use smart pointers is a good mitigation strategy that should be implemented to ensure automatic memory management and prevent potential leaks."

    "justification": "The use of `ValueOrDie()` without checking the status is a valid concern because it can lead to application crashes if the operation fails. The Code Author's proposal to replace `ValueOrDie()` with status checks is necessary to prevent unexpected program termination and improve error handling."
