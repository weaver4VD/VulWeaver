The concern about 'dominify' not being validated is outside the scope of this function, as it is the caller's responsibility to ensure valid arguments.

While the function itself does not directly cause a buffer overflow, adding input validation in 'pstmlist' and 'pstm' is a prudent measure to ensure 'prog' is within expected bounds, mitigating potential vulnerabilities."

Adding input validation at the beginning of the function to check that 'prog' is a valid 'js_Ast' object and contains expected data is necessary to prevent potential security vulnerabilities from malformed or malicious input."
