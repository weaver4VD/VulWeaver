        "justification": "The code does attempt to delete the 'mixer' object twice without checking if it is null after the first deletion, which can lead to a double free vulnerability. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. However, the suggested mitigation from the Author is to add a null check before the second deletion, which would address the vulnerability. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
