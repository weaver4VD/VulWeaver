security_researcher: The identified vulnerability is an Uncontrolled Recursion vulnerability in the code snippet. 

Here is the JSON array representing the vulnerability:

```json
[
    {
        "vulnerability": "Uncontrolled Recursion",
        "reason": "To mitigate the uncontrolled recursion vulnerability, a limit on the recursion depth should be implemented. By setting a maximum recursion depth, the function can prevent stack overflow issues.",
        "impact": "By limiting the recursion depth, the application can prevent potential stack overflow attacks and ensure the stability of the program."
    }
