        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy by ensuring that memory allocated for 'location_entry' and 'extent_entry' is freed before returning from the function. The severity is medium as memory leaks can lead to system slowdown or denial of service. The recommended action is to fix the issue immediately to prevent memory exhaustion and ensure efficient memory management."
