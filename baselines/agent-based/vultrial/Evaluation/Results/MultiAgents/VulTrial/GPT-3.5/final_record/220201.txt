        "justification": "The code snippet indeed has a memory leak vulnerability as pointed out by the Security Researcher. The allocation of memory for 'no_type' using the 'new' keyword without deallocation can lead to memory leaks over time. This can have a medium severity impact on the application's performance and stability. The recommended action is to implement smart pointers like std::unique_ptr to manage memory allocation and deallocation, preventing memory leaks and improving overall application performance."
