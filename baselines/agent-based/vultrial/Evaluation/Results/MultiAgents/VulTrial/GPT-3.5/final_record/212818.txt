        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The Code Author should implement proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Failing to do so could lead to overwriting adjacent memory locations, causing unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Therefore, immediate action is required to address this high-severity issue."
