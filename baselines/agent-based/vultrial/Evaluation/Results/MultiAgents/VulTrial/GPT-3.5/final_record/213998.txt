        "justification": "The code does not explicitly initialize all fields of the OBJECT structure before using it, which can lead to uninitialized memory use. This can result in leaking sensitive information or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Therefore, it is important to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent potential security risks."
