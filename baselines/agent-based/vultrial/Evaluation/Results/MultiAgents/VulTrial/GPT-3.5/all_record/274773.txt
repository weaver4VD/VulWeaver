security_researcher: I have identified the following potential vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet:

1. **Buffer Overflow**:
   - **Reason**: The code does not perform bounds checking when accessing arrays, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Writing beyond the bounds of an array can overwrite memory locations, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.
   - **Impact**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite critical data structures in memory, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

2. **Uncontrolled Format String**:
   - **Reason**: The code uses printf-style debugging output without proper format string validation. If the format string is controlled by user input, it can lead to uncontrolled format string vulnerabilities.
   - **Impact**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the format string argument in printf, leading to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is recommended to implement proper bounds checking for array accesses and ensure that format strings used in printf are not controlled by user input.
