It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by adding memory deallocation before each 'goto error' statement to release the allocated memory."

This can lead to unexpected behavior. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by implementing checks to prevent integer overflow scenarios during calculations."

While these messages are helpful for debugging, they could potentially leak information. It is recommended to monitor and revise the error handling mechanism to provide generic error messages without revealing sensitive information."
