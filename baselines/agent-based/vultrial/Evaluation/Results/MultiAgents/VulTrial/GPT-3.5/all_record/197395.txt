While the recommendation to implement input validation checks is valid and important for preventing arbitrary code execution, the severity is considered medium as the impact of arbitrary code execution can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to enhance the security of the code."
