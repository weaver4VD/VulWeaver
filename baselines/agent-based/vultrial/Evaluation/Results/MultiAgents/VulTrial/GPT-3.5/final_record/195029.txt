        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a memory leak vulnerability in the code where the 'no_type' object is allocated using 'new' but never deallocated using 'delete'. This can lead to continuous memory allocation without release, causing memory exhaustion and performance degradation over time. The recommended action is to add a destructor function to the Node class that deletes the 'no_type' object when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory management."
