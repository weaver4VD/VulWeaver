        "justification": "The vulnerability of buffer overflow is partially valid as the code lacks proper bounds checking when copying data from the user input buffer to 'buffer->ptr'. Implementing bounds checking for the 'words' value can prevent overwriting adjacent memory locations, reducing the risk of crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution."

        "justification": "The missing input validation vulnerability is partially valid as the code does not validate the 'count' parameter before calculating the 'words' value. Implementing proper checks for 'count' can prevent unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, and security vulnerabilities by ensuring input within acceptable limits."
