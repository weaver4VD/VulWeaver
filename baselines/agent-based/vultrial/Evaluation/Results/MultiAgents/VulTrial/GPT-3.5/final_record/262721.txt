The severity is high due to the risk of crashes or unauthorized access to sensitive data. Immediate action is recommended to implement proper bounds checking."

        "justification": "The vulnerability of memory leak is valid as the code does not have a cleanup routine to release allocated memory in case of 'keys' allocation failure, leading to memory exhaustion. The severity is medium as it could cause system unresponsiveness or crashes. Immediate action is recommended to add a cleanup routine for proper memory management."
