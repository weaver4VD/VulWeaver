The Code Author also acknowledges this vulnerability and suggests a mitigation strategy by recommending to free the allocated memory. However, the code snippet provided does not include the suggested fix of calling g_free(base_name) before the return statement. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately to prevent memory leaks."
