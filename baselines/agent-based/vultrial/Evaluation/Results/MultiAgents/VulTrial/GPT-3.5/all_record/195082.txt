        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid as there is a potential risk of using an uninitialized variable 'intercept_smi' in the code. It is crucial to ensure that 'intercept_smi' is properly initialized or declared before being used in the 'if' condition to prevent unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities. The severity is considered medium as uninitialized variables can lead to serious issues. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to enhance the code's reliability and security."
