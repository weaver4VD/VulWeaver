The Code Author should implement bounds checking to prevent unauthorized access and modification of memory outside the allocated space, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential crashes or arbitrary code execution."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the Security Researcher highlighted the risk of unchecked pointer dereference with pointers 'p' and '((__be32 *)p)'. The Code Author should validate and sanitize these pointers before dereferencing to ensure memory locations are valid and intended, reducing the risk of crashes, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution by an attacker."
