Based on the Review Board's analysis, the vulnerabilities identified by the Security Researcher have been reviewed and the following verdicts have been provided:

1. **Buffer Overflow**:
   - **Decision**: Valid
   - **Severity**: High
   - **Recommended Action**: Fix immediately
   - **Justification**: The use of fixed-size arrays without proper bounds checking can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to overwrite adjacent memory locations and potentially execute arbitrary code. Dynamic memory allocation should be used to prevent buffer overflow issues.

2. **Potential Infinite Loop**:
   - **Decision**: Valid
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Recommended Action**: Fix immediately
   - **Justification**: The potential for an infinite loop due to the while loop condition lacking additional exit conditions poses a risk of denial of service. It is crucial to add exit conditions to ensure the loop terminates under all scenarios.

The identified vulnerabilities are valid and require immediate action to mitigate the risks associated with buffer overflow and potential infinite loop scenarios.
