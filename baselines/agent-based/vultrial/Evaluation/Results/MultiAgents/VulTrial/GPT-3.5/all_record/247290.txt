Without proper synchronization mechanisms, concurrent access and updates to the 'out_min_max' variable by multiple threads can lead to data races and incorrect calculation results. Implementing mutex or critical sections for synchronization is crucial to prevent such issues and ensure the correctness of the calculation."
