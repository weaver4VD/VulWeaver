This could lead to a gradual depletion of memory over time. The severity is medium as it can impact application stability. The recommended action is to fix immediately by ensuring memory is properly freed in all code paths."

        "justification": "The vulnerability of resource exhaustion is valid as there is no limit set for the while loop that reads and dispatches messages, potentially leading to indefinite resource consumption. This could be exploited for denial of service attacks. The severity is high as it can lead to application unresponsiveness. The recommended action is to fix immediately by setting a maximum number of iterations for the loop."

The severity is medium as it can impact application stability and security. The recommended action is to fix immediately by implementing comprehensive error handling for all error cases."
