This could allow attackers to manipulate the input and execute arbitrary code, leading to severe security breaches or unauthorized access.

Implementing a check for integer overflow and proper input validation is necessary to prevent unexpected behavior, crashes, or exploitation by attackers. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate this vulnerability and enhance code security."
