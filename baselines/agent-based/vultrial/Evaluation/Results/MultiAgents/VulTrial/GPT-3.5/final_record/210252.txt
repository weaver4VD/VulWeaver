        "justification": "The code is susceptible to integer overflow due to improper checks when incrementing 'offset' with the result of 'ReadBlobLong' or 'ReadBlobFloat'. To address this, proper checks should be added to prevent integer overflow during arithmetic operations."

To enhance security, more rigorous validation should be implemented to prevent malformed or unexpected data from causing vulnerabilities."
