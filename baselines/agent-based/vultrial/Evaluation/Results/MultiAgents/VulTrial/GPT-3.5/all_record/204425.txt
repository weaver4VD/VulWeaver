The code is indeed vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the lack of proper bounds checking when using the memcpy function. This could lead to potential code execution. The suggested mitigation from the Code Author to add bounds checking and consider safer functions like 'memcpy_s' is valid and should be implemented immediately to prevent exploitation."
