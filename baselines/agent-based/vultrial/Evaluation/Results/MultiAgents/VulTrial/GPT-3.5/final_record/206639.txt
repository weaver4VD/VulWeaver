        "justification": "The code does have a potential vulnerability related to switch case fallthrough. The Security Researcher correctly identified that the 'fallthrough' statement should be replaced with a 'break' statement to prevent unintended execution of subsequent case blocks. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. Therefore, the mitigation suggested by the Security Researcher is valid. However, the severity is considered medium as it could potentially lead to security issues. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately."
