security_researcher: I have identified the following potential vulnerabilities in the given code snippet:

1. **Buffer Overflow**:
   - **Reason**: The `cpc` array is declared with a fixed size of `MAX_MCO`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the size of the input exceeds the allocated memory.
   - **Impact**: Exploiting this vulnerability could result in overwriting adjacent memory locations, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even code execution.

2. **Integer Overflow**:
   - **Reason**: The code lacks proper input validation and bounds checking, which could result in integer overflow vulnerabilities when performing arithmetic operations.
   - **Impact**: Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security breaches by manipulating integer values to exceed their maximum limit.

It is recommended to address these vulnerabilities by implementing appropriate mitigation strategies such as dynamic memory allocation, bounds checking, input validation, and using data types with larger ranges to prevent buffer overflows and integer overflows.
