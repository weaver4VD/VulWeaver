        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code is indeed vulnerable to an integer overflow when casting the size of example_weights to an int without checking if it exceeds the maximum limit of an int. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the size of example_weights is too large. The recommended action is to implement a check on the size of example_weights before casting it to an int to prevent potential overflow issues. This fix should be implemented immediately to mitigate the risk of integer overflow."
