        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The code already implements proper bounds checking to ensure memory accesses are within allocated memory bounds. TensorShape and TensorShapeUtils are used to handle tensor dimensions appropriately, reducing the risk of memory corruption. While the vulnerability is valid, the existing measures mitigate the impact to a medium severity level, so monitoring the code for any potential improvements is recommended."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "Thorough input validation checks are already in place for 'axis_', 'input_min_tensor', and 'input_max_tensor' inputs. The code verifies values, data types, and criteria to prevent vulnerabilities. Error handling mechanisms catch invalid inputs. The vulnerability is valid but with low severity, so monitoring for any future enhancements is advised."
