        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the code related to 'match_length' potentially exceeding 'window_size'. The suggested mitigation of adding bounds checking is valid and crucial to prevent memory corruption. However, the severity is high as exploitation could lead to serious consequences."

Implementing proper validation to prevent overflow conditions is essential. The severity is medium as it could lead to unexpected behavior but may not have immediate critical impact."

Initializing 'ret' to a known value is a valid mitigation strategy to prevent unpredictable behavior. The severity is low as it may not have immediate critical impact but is still important to address."
