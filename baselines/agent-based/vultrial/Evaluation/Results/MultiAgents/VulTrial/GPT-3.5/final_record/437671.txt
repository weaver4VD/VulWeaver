The impact of this vulnerability could lead to resource exhaustion. The Code Author should implement the suggested mitigation strategy by adding 'free(b);' before each 'return' statement to release the allocated memory and prevent memory leaks."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code. However, the Code Author's implementation already includes checks on the 'size' value to ensure it is within safe limits before allocating memory for buffer 'b'. This mitigates the risk of buffer overflow attacks. The impact of this vulnerability is low, and no further action is needed."
