        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the code. Adding a check to verify if 'priv->ndev' is not NULL before accessing 'priv->ndev->nfc_dev->fw_download_in_progress' is a valid mitigation strategy. This will prevent the code from dereferencing a NULL pointer and avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. However, the severity is considered medium as it could lead to stability issues and potential exploitation by attackers if not addressed. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to ensure the code's reliability."
