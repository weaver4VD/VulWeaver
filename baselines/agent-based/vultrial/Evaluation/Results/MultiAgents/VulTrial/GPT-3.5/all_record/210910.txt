    "response_type": "mitigation",
    "reason": "To mitigate the risk of unrestricted recursion, a depth counter can be implemented to limit the number of recursive calls allowed. By setting a reasonable threshold for recursion depth, the function can prevent stack overflow and potential DoS attacks. Additionally, proper input validation and error handling should be implemented to handle exceptional cases.",
    "impact": "Implementing a recursion depth limit will prevent excessive resource consumption and potential program crashes, enhancing the overall stability and security of the application."

    "response_type": "refutation",
    "reason": "The use of the 'busy' static variable in this context is appropriate and serves the intended purpose of preventing recursive calls from causing issues. Since the function is not designed to be thread-safe or used in a multi-threaded environment, the risk of race conditions or unexpected behavior due to static variable misuse is minimal. As long as the function is used as intended in a single-threaded environment, the 'busy' variable effectively prevents recursive calls without introducing significant vulnerabilities.",
