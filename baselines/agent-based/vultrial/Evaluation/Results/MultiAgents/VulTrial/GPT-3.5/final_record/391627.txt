        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does not perform length validation before copying the input buffer to 'drc_name', which could lead to a buffer overflow. The recommendation to use 'strncpy' with proper length validation is valid to mitigate this issue. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of a buffer overflow can be significant. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent potential exploitation."
