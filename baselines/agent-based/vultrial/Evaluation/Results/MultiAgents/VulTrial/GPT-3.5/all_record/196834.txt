While the Security Researcher correctly pointed out the risk associated with 'nvals' potentially exceeding the data type limit, the Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of implementing proper input validation is effective in addressing this issue. However, the code currently lacks this validation, hence the severity is medium and the recommended action is to implement proper input validation."
