This can be achieved by ensuring that the length of 'cf->data' does not exceed the size of the destination buffer 'usb_msg.data'. Additionally, using safer functions like 'memcpy_s' that include bounds checking can help prevent buffer overflows."

Immediate action is required to implement proper bounds checking and use safer functions like 'memcpy_s' to prevent buffer overflows."
