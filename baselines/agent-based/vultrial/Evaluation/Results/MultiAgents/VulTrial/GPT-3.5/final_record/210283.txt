        "justification": "The code does not perform sufficient validation on the file descriptor 'fd', memory size 'mmap_size', and memory offset 'mmap_offset' before calling mmap. This leaves the code vulnerable to arbitrary memory mapping attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized memory access and exploitation. Proper input validation and error handling should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability."

        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code is susceptible to resource leaks as it fails to deallocate memory for 'inflight_info' in case of errors during memory allocation. This could result in gradual depletion of system resources and potential denial of service. Proper error handling and memory deallocation should be added to address this vulnerability."
