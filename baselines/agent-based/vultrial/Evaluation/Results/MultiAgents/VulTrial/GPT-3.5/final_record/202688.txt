        "justification": "The code indeed lacks bounds checking before accessing the ImageBuf array, which poses a high risk of buffer overflow. Adding bounds checking to ensure the calculated index stays within array bounds is crucial to prevent potential crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution. The suggested mitigation strategy aligns with best practices and should be implemented as soon as possible."
