This could lead to a null pointer dereference and potential crash or memory corruption. The Code Author's suggested mitigation of adding a check at the beginning of the function is valid and should be implemented to address this issue."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential memory corruption due to lack of validation for the 'shape_map' parameter being null is valid. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access and system instability. The Code Author's suggestion to validate the 'shape_map' parameter for null at the beginning of the function is a valid mitigation strategy and should be applied to prevent this vulnerability."

While the Code Author justified this as necessary for debugging, it is important to ensure that the logs are appropriately secured and access-controlled to prevent unauthorized access. Monitoring and reviewing the logging mechanism for sensitive data exposure is recommended."
