    "reason": "To mitigate the memory leak issue, memory allocated for flxdec->frame_data and flxdec->delta_data should be freed before reassigning new memory to these pointers. Proper memory management practices, such as deallocating memory when it is no longer needed, should be followed to prevent memory leaks.",
