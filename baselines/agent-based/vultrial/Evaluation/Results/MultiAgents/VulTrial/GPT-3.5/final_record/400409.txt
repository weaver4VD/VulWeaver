        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential vulnerability of arithmetic overflow due to the lack of input parameter validation. The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of adding a check to ensure col_arg is within a valid range is valid and should be implemented. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential exploits."
