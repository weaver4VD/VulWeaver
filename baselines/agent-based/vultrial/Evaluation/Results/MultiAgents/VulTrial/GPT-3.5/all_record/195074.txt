The code does not free the memory allocated for 'a' if the allocation for 'a->obu' fails, leading to a memory leak.

Adding a check to free the memory allocated for 'a' if the allocation for 'a->obu' fails will help mitigate this issue."

No bounds checking is performed when reading data into 'a->obu' from the bitstream, which could lead to buffer overflow if the buffer size is exceeded.
