The recursive calls in the gdImageFillToBorder function can indeed lead to a stack overflow if the recursion depth becomes too large. However, the suggested mitigation provided by the Code Author to refactor the function to use an iterative approach is a valid solution to reduce the risk of stack overflow. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix immediately by refactoring the function."
