Implement input validation checks to ensure that only expected and safe input is processed. Additionally, consider using functions like 'system()' or 'exec()' with caution and avoid passing user input directly to them."

Implement strict input validation to ensure that only safe and expected expressions are evaluated. Consider limiting the use of functions that directly execute user input as code, and validate the input against a whitelist of allowed expressions."
