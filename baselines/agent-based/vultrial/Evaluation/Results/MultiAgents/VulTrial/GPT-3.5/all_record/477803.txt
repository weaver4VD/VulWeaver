This could lead to memory corruption, crashes, or other undefined behavior. The recommended mitigation strategy provided by the Security Researcher to add a check before the operation is valid and should be implemented to prevent the risk of integer overflow. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
