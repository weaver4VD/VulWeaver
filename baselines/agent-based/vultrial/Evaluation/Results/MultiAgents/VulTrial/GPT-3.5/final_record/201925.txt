        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does indeed have a memory leak as the allocated memory for 'e' and 'ctx' is not freed in case of an error after allocation. This can lead to gradual depletion of available memory and potential system slowdown, instability, or denial of service. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher to add proper cleanup code is valid and should be implemented to fix the memory leak issue."
