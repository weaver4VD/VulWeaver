        "justification": "The Security Researcher highlighted the risk of Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) by manipulating the 'uid' parameter to delete unauthorized keys. The proposed mitigation of implementing proper authorization checks is valid and necessary to prevent unauthorized data deletion. This vulnerability has a medium severity as it could lead to unauthorized data access."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher pointed out the risk of Unrestricted File Upload by not validating the content before storing it in the database. This could allow malicious content to be uploaded, leading to harmful code execution. Implementing content validation checks as suggested is valid and essential to prevent this vulnerability. The severity is medium as it could lead to the storage of harmful code."
