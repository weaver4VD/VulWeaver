        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the memory leak issue in the code where the dynamically allocated memory for cmdopts is not freed before exiting the function. The Code Author should add a cleanup step at the end of the function to release the allocated memory using free(cmdopts). This will prevent memory leaks and potential denial of service. The suggested mitigation is clear and actionable."
