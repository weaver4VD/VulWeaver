        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to the lack of validation for hash_length against EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the hash_length exceeds the maximum size allowed for the hash_buffer. The recommended mitigation provided by the Security Researcher is valid and should be implemented to add a validation check for hash_length. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact could potentially lead to memory corruption and exploitation by an attacker."
