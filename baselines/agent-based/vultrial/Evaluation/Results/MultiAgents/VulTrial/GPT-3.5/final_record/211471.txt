The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy to add additional checks. While the proposed mitigation is valid, it is only partially implemented, hence the severity is medium. Immediate action is recommended to fully address this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the Missing Authentication vulnerability, highlighting the absence of a robust authentication mechanism. The Code Author also acknowledged the issue and suggested implementing secure authentication protocols. This vulnerability is valid and has a high severity as it can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the BGP routing infrastructure. Immediate action is recommended to implement a robust authentication mechanism."
