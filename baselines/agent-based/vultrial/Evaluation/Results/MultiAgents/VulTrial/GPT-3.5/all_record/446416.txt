The impact of memory leaks can be significant over time, causing performance degradation or denial of service. It is crucial to free all allocated memory before returning NULL in the 'beach' label to ensure proper resource management."

This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Adding explicit checks to prevent integer overflow is crucial to ensure the program behaves predictably and securely."
