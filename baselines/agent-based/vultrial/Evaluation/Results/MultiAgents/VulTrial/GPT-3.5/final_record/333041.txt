This could lead to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. Proper bounds checking and safer functions like 'strncpy' or 'snprintf' should be implemented to prevent buffer overflows."

        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The Potential Infinite Loop vulnerability is invalid as the loop has termination conditions based on input data and the skip_to_start function. As long as the input data is well-formed and the skip_to_start function behaves as expected, there should not be an infinite loop. Proper testing and validation of input data can ensure the loop terminates correctly."
