        "justification": "The code indeed lacks proper bounds checking before using memcpy, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if 'count' exceeds the size of the 'data' buffer. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. However, the Author's suggestion for mitigation aligns with best practices. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a high severity, and immediate action should be taken to implement proper bounds checking."
