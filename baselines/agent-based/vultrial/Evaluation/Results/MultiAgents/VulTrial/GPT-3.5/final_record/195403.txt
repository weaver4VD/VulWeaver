        "justification": "The code does not check if the memory allocation using malloc was successful, which can lead to potential NULL pointer dereference. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. However, the Code Author's response suggests a mitigation strategy to handle the failure gracefully. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the code should be fixed immediately to prevent crashes and security vulnerabilities."
