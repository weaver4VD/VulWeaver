This could lead to potential denial of service due to memory exhaustion. The severity is medium as it can impact system stability.

        "justification": "The potential buffer overflow vulnerability is valid as there is a lack of check to ensure 'ticklen' does not exceed the allocated memory size for 's->session->tlsext_tick' before copying data. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or application crash. The severity is high as it can lead to security breaches. The recommended action is to fix it immediately to prevent buffer overflows."
