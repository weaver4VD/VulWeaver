This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the freed memory region. The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of setting the pointer to NULL after freeing the memory is a valid approach to prevent exploitation. However, the code currently lacks this mitigation step, making it only partially valid. The severity is medium as the vulnerability could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or execution of arbitrary code."
