The severity is high because exploiting this vulnerability could have serious consequences. The recommended action is to fix it immediately by implementing proper bounds checking and using safer functions like 'strncpy' or 'snprintf'."

        "justification": "The Uncontrolled Format String vulnerability is valid as there is insufficient validation of input parameters, which could allow attackers to manipulate format specifiers and execute malicious code. The severity is medium as it could lead to format string attacks with potential information leakage or code execution. The recommended action is to fix it immediately by implementing proper validation and sanitization of parameters before calling vulnerable functions."
