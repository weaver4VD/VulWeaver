        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code does not currently check the combined length of 'argv[4]' and 'argv[5]' before writing to 'str_host' buffer using 'snprintf', which leaves it vulnerable to buffer overflow. Implementing proper input validation and handling as suggested by the Security Researcher will help mitigate this vulnerability."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code should ensure that 'free' is called for 'str_host' in all possible code paths where memory allocation occurs to prevent memory leaks. Addressing memory leaks will optimize resource usage and prevent performance degradation."
