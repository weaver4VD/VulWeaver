security_researcher: I have identified multiple memory leak vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet. Here are the details:

1. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leaks, ensure that memory allocated for 'pglob->gl_pathv' is freed in all error paths and after its usage.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.

2. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leak, free the memory allocated for 'onealt' using malloc in all execution paths where it is allocated.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.

3. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leak, free the memory allocated for 'newp' using malloc in all execution paths where it is allocated.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.

4. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leak, free the memory allocated for 'dirname' using malloc in all execution paths where it is allocated.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.

5. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leak, free the memory allocated for 'newp' using malloc in all execution paths where it is allocated.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.

6. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leak, free the memory allocated for 'new_gl_pathv' using realloc in case of an error.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.

7. **Memory Leak**:
   - **Reason**: To mitigate the memory leak, free the memory allocated for 'new' using realloc in case of an error.
   - **Impact**: Repeated execution of the code can exhaust the available memory, causing denial of service.
