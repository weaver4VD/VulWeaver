The impact of this vulnerability could lead to serious consequences such as crashes, data corruption, or execution of arbitrary code. The recommended action of using safer functions like strncpy and implementing input validation is crucial to prevent buffer overflow attacks."

        "justification": "The Review Board refutes the claim of a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the code. The loop condition 'while (1)' in the specified section correctly terminates when encountering a null terminator in szLine, preventing any possibility of integer overflow. Therefore, no action is needed to address this non-existent vulnerability."
