        "justification": "The identified memory leak vulnerability is partially valid as the allocated memory for huffcdic->symbols is not freed before the function returns, leading to potential memory leaks. The proposed mitigation strategy to free the allocated memory is valid and should be implemented to address this issue."

        "justification": "The concern raised about potential null pointer dereference is valid. The code already includes a check for NULL at the beginning of the loop where 'curr' is dereferenced, preventing any null pointer dereference issues. It is recommended to monitor this area for any future changes that may impact this safeguard."
