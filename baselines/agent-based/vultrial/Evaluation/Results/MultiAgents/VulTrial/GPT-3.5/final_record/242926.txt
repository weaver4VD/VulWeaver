        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential information leakage through detailed error messages that expose tensor shapes and indices. The impact of such leakage could be significant, allowing attackers to understand the system's internal workings and potentially launch targeted attacks. The Code Author's suggestion to provide generic error messages is a valid mitigation strategy to address this vulnerability. However, since the code currently exposes sensitive information, immediate action is required to fix the error messages and prevent potential data leakage."
