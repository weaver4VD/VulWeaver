In this case, you can use functions like `utils::replace_all` and `stfl::quote` to properly sanitize the user-controlled input before constructing the command line. Additionally, consider using platform-specific APIs or libraries that handle command execution securely to prevent command injection attacks."

To fully address the vulnerability, additional input validation and sanitization techniques should be implemented, and consideration should be given to using platform-specific secure APIs for command execution."
