The code does not have a check for division by zero in the TF_LITE_CHECK_DIV_NON_ZERO macro, which can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if input2 contains zero values. Adding a check in the macro to ensure input2 does not contain zero values before performing the division operation is recommended to mitigate this risk."
