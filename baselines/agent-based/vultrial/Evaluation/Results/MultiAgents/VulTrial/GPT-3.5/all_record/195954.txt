While the recommendation to implement proper input validation before allocating memory is correct, the code snippet provided already includes memory allocation for the name with a length of name_len+4. However, the code should still validate the length obtained from the packet to ensure it does not exceed a safe limit defined by the application to fully address the potential buffer overflow risk."
