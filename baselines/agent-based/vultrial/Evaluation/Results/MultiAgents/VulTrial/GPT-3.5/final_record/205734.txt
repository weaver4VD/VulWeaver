        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code indeed allocates memory for 's1' and 's2' using malloc but does not free this memory in case of an error condition, leading to potential memory leaks. The suggested mitigation provided by the Security Researcher to free the allocated memory before returning NULL is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks."
