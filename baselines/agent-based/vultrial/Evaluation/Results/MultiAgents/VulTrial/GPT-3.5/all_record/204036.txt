The recommendation to add bounds checking before performing the memory copy operation in the hw_atl_utils_fw_downld_dwords function is valid and crucial to prevent buffer overflow. However, the severity is considered high as the impact of a buffer overflow can be severe, allowing attackers to write beyond the allocated buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent any security risks."
