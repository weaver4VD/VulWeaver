        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does not perform bounds checking when reading the catalog_bitmap from the file, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The Security Researcher's suggestion to add bounds checking is valid. However, the Code Author's response to mitigate the vulnerability by validating the size before allocating memory is also valid. Therefore, the decision is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix immediately to prevent potential buffer overflow issues."
