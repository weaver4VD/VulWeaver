        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about unauthenticated firmware download abort is partially valid. While the code does check for firmware download in progress before aborting, it lacks a secure authentication mechanism to verify the legitimacy of the request. Implementing such a mechanism would enhance the security of the firmware download process."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about memory corruption is valid. The code does not properly initialize and validate the 'priv' pointer before accessing or freeing memory, which could lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities. Implementing proper error handling, input validation, and safer memory management practices is crucial to prevent unauthorized manipulation and potential system compromise."
