The Code Author also acknowledged this issue and provided a mitigation strategy. However, the mitigation strategy was not implemented in the code. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity as it can lead to memory leaks over time if not addressed."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher pointed out the potential NULL pointer dereference issue in the code where 'segments' is returned without checking if it is NULL after the allocation for 'bs' fails. The Code Author suggested a mitigation strategy to handle this scenario, but it was not implemented in the code. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity as it can lead to unexpected behavior or segmentation faults if not addressed."
