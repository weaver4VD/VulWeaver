Input validation checks should be implemented before copying the 'args' structure to prevent memory corruption, buffer overflows, and arbitrary code execution. The severity is high due to the critical impact of memory corruption. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."

Thorough input validation mechanisms should be incorporated for the 'args' structure to prevent denial of service, information disclosure, and privilege escalation vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as it poses significant security risks. Immediate action is advised to mitigate this vulnerability."
