However, there is a risk of overwriting adjacent memory locations if proper bounds checking is not implemented. Therefore, the mitigation is partially valid and requires additional validation to fully address the issue."

        "justification": "The code does not validate the length of the data copied into the request buffer for USB descriptor types, which could lead to potential information disclosure. Implementing proper length validation will prevent leaking sensitive information and enhance security. Therefore, the vulnerability is valid and should be fixed immediately."

Implementing appropriate checks and error handling for delayed status requests will prevent system instability. The vulnerability is valid and should be fixed immediately."
