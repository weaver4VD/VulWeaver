        "justification": "The Review Board agrees with the Security Researcher's identification of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the 'count' variable calculation. The impact of this vulnerability could be severe, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory locations or execute arbitrary code. The suggested mitigation provided by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow issues. However, the code still lacks the necessary check to ensure that 'count' is within the bounds of the buffer, hence the decision of partially valid."
