The Code Author also acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy. However, the code still lacks the necessary bounds checking implementation, making it only partially valid.

The Code Author also recognized the issue and suggested implementing proper memory management practices. This vulnerability is valid and has a high severity as it can lead to memory manipulation after freeing, potentially resulting in crashes, data corruption, or remote code execution."
