        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code is indeed at risk of a buffer overflow due to the assumption of the size of 'cgrp->root->release_agent_path'. However, the Code Author's response suggests a mitigation strategy by performing explicit validation of the input buffer size before copying it. This mitigation approach can help prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Therefore, the severity is considered medium, and the recommended action is to fix immediately by implementing the suggested mitigation."
