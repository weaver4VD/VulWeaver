        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the memory leak vulnerability in the code due to the use of raw pointers without proper memory cleanup. The Code Author also acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy using smart pointers. However, the code still uses raw pointers in several places without proper memory cleanup, indicating that the mitigation strategy has not been fully implemented. Therefore, the vulnerability is considered partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
