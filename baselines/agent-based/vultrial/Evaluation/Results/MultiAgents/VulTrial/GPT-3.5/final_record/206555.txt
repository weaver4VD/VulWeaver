        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to the lack of bounds checking before using memcpy. The Code Author also acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy. However, since the code still lacks proper bounds checking, the vulnerability is only partially addressed. Immediate action is needed to implement the suggested mitigation and prevent potential exploits."
