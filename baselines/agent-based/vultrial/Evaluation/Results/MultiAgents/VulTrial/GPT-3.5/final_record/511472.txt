            "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the vulnerability related to stack buffer overflow. The suggested mitigation to pass the 'alias' variable directly to the function is valid and would reduce the risk of buffer overflows. Implementing this change is crucial to enhance the code's security."

            "recommended_action": "monitor",
            "justification": "The Security Researcher highlighted the potential deadlock issue, but the code already includes mechanisms to handle deadlocks effectively. The existing error handling and deadlock detection mechanisms mitigate the risk of deadlocks to a reasonable extent. Therefore, no immediate action is needed, but continuous monitoring is recommended."
