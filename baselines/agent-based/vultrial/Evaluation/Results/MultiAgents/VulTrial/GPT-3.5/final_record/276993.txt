        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code allows for the transfer of control to a different fiber without proper validation or authorization checks, which can lead to unauthorized access or code execution. This vulnerability poses a high risk and should be addressed immediately to prevent potential abuse by attackers."

        "decision": "valid",

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code does not include checks to prevent double resuming a fiber, which can result in unexpected behavior or state corruption. While the impact is not as severe as unrestricted transfer of control, it still poses a risk that should be mitigated promptly."

        "justification": "The code lacks boundary checks in pointer arithmetic operations, increasing the risk of memory corruption. While the vulnerability is present, the impact is currently low. It is recommended to monitor for any potential memory corruption issues and consider adding boundary checks in the future to further reduce the risk."
