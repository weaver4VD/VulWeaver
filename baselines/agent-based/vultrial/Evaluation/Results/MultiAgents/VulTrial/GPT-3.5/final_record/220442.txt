        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The Code Author acknowledged the risk of buffer overflow and proposed adding boundary checks for 'n'. However, the code still lacks these boundary checks, leaving the potential for buffer overflow. Adding proper boundary checks to ensure 'n' is within the array length is crucial to prevent buffer overflow."
