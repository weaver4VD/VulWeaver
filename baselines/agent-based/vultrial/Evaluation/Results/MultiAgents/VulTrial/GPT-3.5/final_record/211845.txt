This can result in arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. Immediate action is required to implement bounds checking and prevent buffer overflow attacks."

            "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the allocated memory for 'tile_pixels' in the 'ReadTileMethod' is not properly released, leading to memory leaks. While memory leaks may not have immediate critical impact, they can cause resource exhaustion and reduced performance over time. Immediate action is recommended to implement proper memory management practices and prevent memory leaks."
