        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code indeed allocates memory for s->catalog_bitmap without checking if s->catalog_size is too large, which could lead to a buffer overflow. Adding a check to ensure that s->catalog_size is within a safe range before allocating memory is a valid mitigation strategy. The severity is medium as it could lead to memory corruption or crashes. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately."
