The code indeed lacks proper input validation, which can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities. Implementing proper input validation to validate the type, range, and content of input values is crucial to prevent memory corruption. The severity is considered medium as it can lead to crashes, data leaks, or arbitrary code execution if exploited."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential unhandled exceptions is valid. The code lacks comprehensive error handling mechanisms, which can result in unhandled exceptions and unexpected behavior. Implementing robust error handling, including proper exception and error handling, is crucial to prevent crashes and unpredictable behavior. The severity is considered high as it can be exploited by an attacker for denial of service attacks."
