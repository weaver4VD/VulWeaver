The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy to ensure proper freeing of 'iovec' memory. However, the code currently lacks the implementation of freeing 'iovec' memory in all code paths before returning, which poses a medium severity risk of memory leaks over time. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent potential memory leaks."
