        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does indeed have a memory leak issue as the allocated memory for the base_name variable is not freed before returning from the function. This can lead to memory exhaustion over repeated executions. The suggested mitigation of freeing the memory before the return statement is valid and should be implemented to prevent potential denial of service. The severity is considered medium as it can impact system performance over time."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is considered invalid in this context. The code does not exhibit a potential use-after-free vulnerability as the resources are handled appropriately. The Security Researcher suggested canceling the asynchronous operation before freeing the odata structure, but the code already handles the cleanup of resources in a safe manner. Therefore, no action is needed for this specific vulnerability."
