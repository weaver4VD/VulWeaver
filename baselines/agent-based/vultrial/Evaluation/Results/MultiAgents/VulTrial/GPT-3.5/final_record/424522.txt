        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does check if the calculated size 's' exceeds INT32_MAX before proceeding. However, the suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher provides an additional step to prevent the overflow by checking if either width or height is greater than INT32_MAX / 4. Implementing this additional check would further enhance the code's security and prevent potential integer overflow issues."
