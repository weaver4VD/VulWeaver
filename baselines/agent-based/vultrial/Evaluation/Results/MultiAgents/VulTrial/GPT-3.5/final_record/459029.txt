        "justification": "The code does not currently have proper bounds checking before accessing elements in the 'hd' array using index 'u', which leaves it vulnerable to a potential buffer overflow. The Security Researcher's suggestion to implement bounds checking is valid. However, the impact of this vulnerability is considered medium as it could lead to serious consequences if exploited. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent any potential security risks."
