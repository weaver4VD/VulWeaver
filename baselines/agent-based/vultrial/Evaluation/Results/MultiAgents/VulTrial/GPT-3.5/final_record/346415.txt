        "justification": "The code does not implement proper bounds checking when reading input, which leaves it vulnerable to buffer overflow. While the Code Author acknowledged the issue and suggested using safer functions like 'fgets', the code still lacks explicit bounds checking. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid and requires immediate fixing to prevent potential exploitation."

        "justification": "The code does not ensure there is enough space in the buffer for the null terminator, which can lead to undefined behavior and memory corruption. The Security Researcher's recommendation to allocate an extra byte for the null terminator or use safer string manipulation functions is valid. This vulnerability is low severity but should be fixed immediately to prevent potential issues."
