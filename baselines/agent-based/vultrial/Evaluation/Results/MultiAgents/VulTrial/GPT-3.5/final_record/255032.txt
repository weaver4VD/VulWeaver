        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The Security Researcher correctly pointed out the potential buffer overflow in the init_get_bits8() function due to the size parameter not being validated against the actual buffer size. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to add a check for the size parameter is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
