        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code does not currently implement proper bounds checking when copying input lines to the temporary buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow. The Security Researcher's recommendation to implement bounds checking aligns with best practices to prevent overflow and potential exploitation."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code lacks robust input validation mechanisms, specifically when parsing Gopher directory entries. Validating the presence of expected delimiters like TAB characters before processing input is crucial to prevent parsing errors and ensure expected behavior. Implementing input validation as suggested by the Security Researcher is necessary to address this vulnerability."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "low",

        "justification": "The code does not free the memory allocated for 'escaped_selector' using 'safe_free' when it is no longer needed, leading to potential memory leaks. The Security Researcher's recommendation to free allocated memory properly aligns with best practices for efficient memory management. Addressing this vulnerability is essential to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimal performance."
