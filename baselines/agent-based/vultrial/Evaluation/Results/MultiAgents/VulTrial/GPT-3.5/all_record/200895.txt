    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified two vulnerabilities in the code: Unvalidated Input and Potential Memory Leak. They highlighted the risks of buffer overflow, out-of-bound access, and memory leaks due to lack of input validation and memory management.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the vulnerabilities and provided mitigation strategies for both issues. They suggested implementing input validation checks for 'start_idx' and 'end_idx' parameters to prevent buffer overflow and out-of-bound access. Additionally, they recommended checking and freeing allocated memory before assigning a new value to 'qftf_list' to prevent memory leaks."
