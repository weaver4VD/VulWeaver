However, the code still lacks explicit length checks before copying data into the transaction structure, leaving the potential for buffer overflow attacks. Immediate action is required to fully mitigate this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The Uninitialized Memory Read vulnerability is valid as the code does not ensure proper initialization of transaction->aid_len before accessing memory locations. This could lead to reading from uninitialized memory locations, posing a high risk of data leakage or unpredictable behavior. Immediate action is necessary to initialize all variables and implement strict validation checks to prevent exploitation."
