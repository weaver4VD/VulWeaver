        "reason": "To address the unrestricted file access vulnerability, validate and sanitize the file paths stored in 'input_filename' and 'filename' variables. Implement proper input validation mechanisms to ensure that only authorized file paths can be accessed. Consider using absolute paths or restricting access to specific directories to prevent unauthorized file access."

Implement input validation to filter out any malicious characters or commands that could be injected. Use secure coding practices such as parameterized queries or escaping user input to prevent command injection attacks."
