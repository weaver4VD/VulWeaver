While input validation should be added to the 'user_tick' parameter in the 'update_process_times' function to prevent potential information leakage, the impact of this vulnerability may not be as severe as initially described. Adding input validation can help mitigate the risk of malicious manipulation or exploitation of the parameter. Therefore, it is recommended to fix this issue immediately."
