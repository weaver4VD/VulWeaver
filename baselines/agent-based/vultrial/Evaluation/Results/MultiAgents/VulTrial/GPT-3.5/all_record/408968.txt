The code does not implement proper bounds checking when copying characters into the 'buf' array, which could lead to buffer overflow. Using functions like 'strncpy' with a specified length limit is recommended to prevent exceeding the buffer size. This issue poses a medium severity risk as it could potentially enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Immediate action should be taken to address this vulnerability."
