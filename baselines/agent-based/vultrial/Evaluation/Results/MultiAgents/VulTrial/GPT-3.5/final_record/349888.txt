        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to lack of bounds checking before copying data into 'self->rpc' buffer. The Code Author acknowledged this vulnerability and suggested implementing bounds checking. However, the severity is high as it could lead to critical data overwrite and potential exploits."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about a potential infinite loop vulnerability is valid, but the Code Author's explanation of loop conditions and checks refutes this vulnerability. It is recommended to monitor the loop behavior to ensure it does not lead to denial of service. The severity is medium as it could impact system resources."
