        "justification": "The code does not include a function to free the memory allocated for the RAMBlock structure, leading to a potential memory leak. This can result in excessive memory consumption over time, impacting performance and potentially leading to denial of service. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure efficient memory management."

It is a common practice to keep disabled code for reference or future use without affecting the functionality of the current code. While it may lead to confusion or maintenance issues, it does not pose a security risk."
