        "justification": "The code does have potential memory leak vulnerabilities as identified by the Security Researcher. The Security Researcher's concern is valid as the allocated memory for rsi_dev and tx_buffer is not freed in all failure scenarios. The Code Author's response acknowledges the issue and provides a mitigation strategy. However, since the mitigation is not implemented in the code, the vulnerability is only partially valid. The severity is medium as it can lead to memory leaks and potential denial of service. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by adding proper cleanup steps in all failure scenarios."
