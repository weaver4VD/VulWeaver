        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The 'size' parameter is indeed used in subsequent function calls without proper bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The recommended action is to implement proper bounds checking to validate the 'size' parameter against the expected buffer size to prevent buffer overflow. This is a medium severity issue that should be fixed immediately to prevent potential exploitation."
