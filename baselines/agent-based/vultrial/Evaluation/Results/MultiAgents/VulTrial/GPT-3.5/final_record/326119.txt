            "justification": "The code lacks proper bounds checking when accessing arrays and pointers, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This can result in memory corruption, crashes, or even remote code execution. Adding bounds checking for arrays like `brace_min`, `brace_max`, and `brace_count` in the `BRACE_COMPLEX` case is crucial to prevent out-of-bounds access."
