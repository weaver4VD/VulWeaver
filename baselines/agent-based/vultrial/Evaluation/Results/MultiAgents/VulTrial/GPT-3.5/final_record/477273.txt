        "justification": "The code should indeed check the return value of kmalloc to mitigate the risk of memory allocation failure. Failure to do so can lead to uninitialized memory usage. Implementing appropriate error handling is crucial. The proposed mitigation aligns with the Security Researcher's concern."

        "decision": "invalid",
        "severity": "none",
        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The Code Author's refutation is valid as the code already includes a check for 'rx->skey' before allocating memory for 'skey'. This prevents the potential double-free vulnerability scenario. The existing logic adequately addresses this concern, and no further action is required."
