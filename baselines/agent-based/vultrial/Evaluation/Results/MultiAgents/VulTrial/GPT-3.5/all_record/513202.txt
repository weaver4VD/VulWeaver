The Security Researcher's suggestion to use functions like 'strlcpy' or 'snprintf' is valid for mitigating this vulnerability. However, the code author has acknowledged the vulnerability and provided a mitigation strategy, which aligns with the Security Researcher's recommendation. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid and should be fixed immediately."
