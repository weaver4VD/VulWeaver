        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the Buffer Overflow vulnerability due to the use of unsafe functions like strcpy and strcat. The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy by suggesting the replacement of unsafe functions with safer alternatives like strncpy and strncat. While the proposed mitigation is valid, the code still contains the vulnerable functions, making it only partially valid. The severity is medium as buffer overflow can lead to crashes, denial of service, or remote code execution."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the Unvalidated Input vulnerability in the code. The Code Author also acknowledged the issue and recommended implementing input validation checks to address it. The severity is high as unvalidated input can result in data corruption, injection attacks, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. The recommended action is to fix immediately by implementing proper input validation checks."
