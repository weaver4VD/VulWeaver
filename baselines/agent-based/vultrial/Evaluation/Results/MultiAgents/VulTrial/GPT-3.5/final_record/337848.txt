        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. While the risk of buffer overflow is correctly pointed out, the Code Author has already taken some measures to prevent it by calculating the size of 'stream_list' and adding it to the chunk based on available space. However, it is important to ensure that the size of 'stream_list' is always within the bounds of the chunk buffer to fully mitigate the risk. Therefore, the code should be reviewed to add additional checks to validate the size of 'stream_list' before copying it to the chunk."
