        "justification": "The code lacks proper bounds checking before using memcpy, which can lead to buffer overflow if 'len' is larger than available space. Exploiting this vulnerability could result in memory corruption, crashes, or execution of arbitrary code. Mitigation by implementing proper bounds checking is necessary to prevent this risk."
