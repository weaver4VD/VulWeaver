The code indeed lacks proper bounds checking on the 'spans' array, which could lead to a buffer overflow if 'num_spans' is less than 2. This can have severe consequences such as denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure. The proposed mitigation strategy by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented immediately to address this high-severity issue."
