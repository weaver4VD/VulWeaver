This could lead to buffer overflow and potential arbitrary code execution. The severity is medium as it poses a significant risk. Immediate action is recommended to implement bounds checking and use safe functions for reading data."

This could lead to unexpected behavior and security breaches. The severity is medium as it poses a significant risk. Immediate action is recommended to validate arithmetic operations and prevent integer overflow."

While this could lead to security vulnerabilities, the impact is considered low. It is recommended to monitor and improve input validation and data sanitization practices to prevent potential risks."
