        "reason": "The code performs a cast from 'tmsize_t' to 'long' without validating if the value fits within the range of 'long'. This can result in an integer overflow if 'occ0' is too large, leading to unexpected behavior.",

Verify that the 'occ' value does not exceed the buffer size before writing data to prevent potential memory corruption. Implement boundary checks to ensure safe data handling."

Implement checks to ensure that the conversion does not result in an integer overflow scenario. Consider using safer data types or additional validation logic to handle large input values safely."

Implement checks to prevent entering an infinite loop by validating the input size against the available data. Set appropriate limits or timeouts to prevent excessive resource consumption and mitigate the risk of a DoS attack."

The Buffer Overflow vulnerability arises from writing data to the output buffer without checking the buffer size, the Integer Overflow from a cast without range validation, and the DoS potential from inadequate handling of 'occ' exceeding available data."
