This could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations. The severity is medium as it can result in a crash or arbitrary code execution. Immediate action is recommended to implement proper bounds checking."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as memory allocated for 'indx->entries[entry_number].label' and 'ptagx' is not properly freed in all error conditions, leading to memory leaks. The impact is high as repeated execution without proper deallocation could exhaust available memory resources. Immediate action is recommended to address this issue by adding appropriate deallocation steps."

The 'ptagx' memory is freed only after it has been fully utilized with no retained references, eliminating the risk of use-after-free vulnerability. No action is needed in this scenario."
