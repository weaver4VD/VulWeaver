The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed mitigating the risk by ensuring proper initialization. However, the specific steps to initialize 'p_fic' were not provided in the code snippet, leading to a partially valid decision. Setting a default value or explicitly initializing 'p_fic' before use is crucial to prevent unpredictable behavior and potential exploitation."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher accurately pointed out the presence of a memory leak issue related to memory allocated for 'p'. The Code Author also acknowledged the problem and suggested addressing it by implementing a mechanism to free the allocated memory before the function exits. This is a valid decision as proper memory management is essential to prevent memory leaks and maintain stable performance over time."
