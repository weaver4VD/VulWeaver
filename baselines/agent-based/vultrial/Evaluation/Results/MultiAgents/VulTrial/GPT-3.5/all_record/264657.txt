Calling 'gf_node_unregister' twice on the 'node' object after registering it as the global QP can lead to a use-after-free scenario. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher is also valid and should be implemented to reduce the risk of memory corruption and potential code execution."
