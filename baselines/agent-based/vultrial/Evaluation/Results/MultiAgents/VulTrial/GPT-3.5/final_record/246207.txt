        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential vulnerability of integer overflow due to the initialization of 'nvals' using c->UnknownDim(). The suggested mitigation by adding a check to ensure 'nvals' is non-negative is valid and should be implemented to prevent integer overflow. This vulnerability is partially valid because the code currently lacks this necessary check, making it susceptible to integer overflow attacks."
