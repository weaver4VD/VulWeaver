        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. Moving the call to diFree(inode) before freeing the inode from quota allocation and dropping the inode would indeed mitigate the 'Use After Free' vulnerability. This vulnerability has a medium severity as it could lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any exploitation."
