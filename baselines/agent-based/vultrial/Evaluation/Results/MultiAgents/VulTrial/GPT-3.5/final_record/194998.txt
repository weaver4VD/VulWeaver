        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code snippet indeed allocates memory for Tensor objects in the 'outputs' vector but does not properly deallocate this memory, leading to a potential memory leak. The impact of this vulnerability can be significant, causing increased memory usage over time and potential performance issues. It is important to address this issue by implementing proper memory management practices such as using smart pointers or a custom cleanup mechanism to ensure efficient memory usage."
