This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or overwrite critical data. The severity is high because it can result in crashing the application, executing arbitrary code, bypassing security controls, and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or system resources. The recommended action is to implement bounds checking, use safe functions for reading data, and ensure proper memory allocation to prevent buffer overflow attacks."
