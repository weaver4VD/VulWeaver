        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the COPY_BUF macro due to the lack of boundary checks. The suggested mitigation provided by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow issues. However, since the mitigation was not implemented in the code, the vulnerability is only partially valid. The severity is considered medium as it could lead to memory corruption and potential code execution."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher accurately pointed out the incomplete input validation in the decode_num function, which can lead to processing of malformed input data and security issues. The suggested mitigation by the Code Author to implement proper input validation checks is valid and crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities. The severity is high as it could result in information disclosure, denial of service, or code execution."
