The impact of this vulnerability is significant as attackers could use this information for targeted attacks. The suggested mitigation strategy of generalizing error messages to avoid revealing internal details is valid and should be implemented. However, the code author's perspective is also considered, and the current implementation still exposes sensitive information, hence the verdict is 'partially valid' with a medium severity."
