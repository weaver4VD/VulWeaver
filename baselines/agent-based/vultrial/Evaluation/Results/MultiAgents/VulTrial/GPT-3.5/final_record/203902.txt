The mitigation strategy provided by the Code Author aligns with best practices to address this issue, but it needs to be implemented in the code to fully mitigate the risk."

The mitigation strategy suggested by the Code Author is appropriate and should be implemented to prevent excessive resource consumption and service disruption."
