security_researcher: The identified vulnerability in the code snippet is an "Unrestricted Functionality" issue. 

Here is the mitigation for this vulnerability:
- **Mitigation**: To mitigate the complexity and potential issues related to the extensive conditional logic in the `do_mouse` function, it is recommended to refactor the code into smaller, more manageable functions with clear responsibilities. This will improve code readability, maintainability, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs and vulnerabilities.
- **Impact**: By restructuring the code, developers can better understand and maintain the functionality, leading to a more secure and robust application.
