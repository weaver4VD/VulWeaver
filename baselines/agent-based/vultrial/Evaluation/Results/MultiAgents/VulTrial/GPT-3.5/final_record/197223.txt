The code does not currently check the combined length of 'dir' and 'info->name' before copying them into the 'src' buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the total length exceeds NJS_MAX_PATH. Implementing a check for the total length and handling this condition appropriately would mitigate the risk of buffer overflow."

The code does not validate or sanitize the input path before constructing the file path, which could allow attackers to manipulate the path for directory traversal attacks. Implementing proper input validation checks and path sanitization would mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to files or directories."
