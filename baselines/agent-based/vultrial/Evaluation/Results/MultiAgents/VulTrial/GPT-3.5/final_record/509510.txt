        "justification": "The lack of input validation in the code is a valid concern raised by the Security Researcher. Implementing input validation checks before passing the 'name' parameter to the maria_delete_table_files function is crucial to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. However, the code snippet provided does not show the implementation of input validation checks, hence the vulnerability is only partially valid. It is recommended to address this issue immediately to enhance the security of the code."
