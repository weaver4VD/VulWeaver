        "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the code does free memory in some cases but misses freeing memory in other cases, leading to potential memory leaks. The impact of memory leaks can be significant over time, causing performance degradation or denial of service. It is crucial to free all allocated memory before returning NULL in the 'beach' label to ensure proper resource management."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as there are no explicit checks to prevent potential overflow when adding 'total_slide_infos' and 'n_slide_infos[i]'. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Adding explicit checks to prevent integer overflow is crucial to ensure the program behaves predictably and securely."
