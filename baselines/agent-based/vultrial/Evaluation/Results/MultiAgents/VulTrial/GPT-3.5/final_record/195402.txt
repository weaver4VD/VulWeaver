        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential vulnerability in the code due to the use of a static variable 'dummy' within the function, which can lead to issues in a multi-threaded environment. The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of replacing the static variable with a local variable is valid and should be implemented to avoid potential race conditions and unintended side effects. However, the code still retains the static variable 'dummy', which poses a risk in a multi-threaded environment."
