This can expose critical data to unauthorized access. The severity is medium as it can lead to potential risks.

        "justification": "The vulnerability of Unrestricted Logging is valid as the code logs row indices without proper validation and filtering, potentially exposing internal data structures. The severity is low as it may aid attackers in understanding system behavior. The recommended action is to fix this issue immediately by implementing validation and filtering mechanisms to limit the logging of sensitive information."
