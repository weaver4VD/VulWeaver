security_researcher: I have identified the following potential vulnerabilities in the code snippet:

1. **Buffer Overflow**:
   - **Reason**: The code does not perform proper bounds checking when copying data into the 'string' buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the length of the data being copied exceeds the size of the 'string' buffer.
   - **Impact**: Exploiting this vulnerability could result in overwriting adjacent memory locations, leading to a crash, unexpected behavior, or potential code execution.

2. **Integer Overflow**:
   - **Reason**: There is a risk of integer overflow when calculating the length of the data to be copied into the 'string' buffer. The 'new_slen' variable should be validated to prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities.
   - **Impact**: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the length calculation, leading to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or denial of service.

It is recommended to implement proper bounds checking and validation mechanisms to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
