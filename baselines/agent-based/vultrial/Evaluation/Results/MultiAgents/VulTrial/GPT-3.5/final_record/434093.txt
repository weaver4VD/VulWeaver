This can lead to memory leaks over time. It is important to fix this issue immediately by adding the necessary deallocation of memory."

            "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the 'alist' argument list is unlocked at the end of the function, potentially leading to a use after free scenario. To mitigate this issue, the 'alist' should be re-locked before returning from the function to prevent any access after being unlocked. It is crucial to fix this issue immediately to avoid undefined behavior and security risks."
