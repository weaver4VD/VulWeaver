Adding a corresponding deallocation function or freeing the memory at the end of the function would mitigate the memory leak vulnerability."

The responsibility lies with the caller to ensure m_pEnviron is valid before invoking this function, hence there is no risk of null pointer dereference in this specific code snippet."
