        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential for an integer overflow in the calculation 'buf->offset + aoffset + len'. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The suggested mitigation from the Author to add a check before the calculation is valid and should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact could be significant if exploited."
