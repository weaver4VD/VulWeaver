        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about memory leak is partially valid. The code indeed allocates memory for 'frameRaw.p' and 'frameRaw.rows' but fails to free this memory before returning from the function, leading to potential memory leaks. The impact of this vulnerability can be medium as it can cause gradual memory exhaustion and performance degradation over time. The Author's response acknowledges the issue and suggests freeing the allocated memory to mitigate the vulnerability."

        "recommended_action": "no action needed",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential buffer overflow is invalid. The code structure ensures that the comparison with the PNG signature is done after reading 8 bytes into the 'sig' buffer, preventing buffer overflow risks even if the input data size is less than 8 bytes. The impact of this vulnerability is none as the code guards against buffer overflow risks in the specific scenario mentioned. The Author's refutation of this concern is valid."

        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about unchecked memory allocation is partially valid. The code allocates memory for 'frameRaw.p' and 'frameRaw.rows' without checking if the allocation was successful, potentially leading to undefined behavior if the allocation fails. The impact of this vulnerability can be medium, as it can result in crashes, memory corruption, or other security vulnerabilities. The Author's response acknowledges the need to include checks for successful memory allocation to mitigate this vulnerability."
