        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential vulnerability of integer overflow in the comparison 'tuple.size() == (size_t)ctx->num_outputs()'. Adding an additional check to ensure that 'tuple.size()' does not exceed the maximum value that 'size_t' can hold is a valid mitigation strategy. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of integer overflow could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any potential risks."
