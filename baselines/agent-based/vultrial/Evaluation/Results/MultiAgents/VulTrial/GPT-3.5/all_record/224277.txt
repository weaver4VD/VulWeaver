The code lacks proper cleanup handling for the 'seccomp' filter context, which can lead to memory leaks when the context goes out of scope. Implementing the cleanup function 'cleanup_seccomp' is crucial to free the allocated memory and prevent memory leaks. The severity is considered medium as memory leaks can impact performance and resource consumption. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."
