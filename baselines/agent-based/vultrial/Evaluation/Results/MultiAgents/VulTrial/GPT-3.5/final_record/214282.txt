        "justification": "The code lacks a check to ensure that 'offset + 8' does not exceed 'sz' before accessing memory at that position, which could result in a buffer overflow vulnerability. It is important to add this check to prevent reading beyond the allocated memory buffer and avoid crashing the application."
