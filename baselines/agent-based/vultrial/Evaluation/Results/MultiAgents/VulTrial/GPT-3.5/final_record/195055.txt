        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the loop iterating over 'shape_vector' due to the lack of boundary check for the index 'b'. This could lead to memory corruption or unauthorized access. The suggested mitigation by the Author to add a boundary check is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow. However, since the code currently lacks this check, the vulnerability is only partially valid and carries a medium severity as it could lead to serious consequences if exploited."
