        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid as there is a potential for integer overflow in the code due to the assignment of 'slimit' based on the value of 'cursp()'. The Security Researcher's concern about the risk of integer overflow is valid. It is recommended to implement the suggested mitigation by performing a check on the value of 'cursp()' before assigning it to 'slimit' to prevent integer overflow."
