        "justification": "The code does not provide sufficient protection against path traversal attacks as identified by the Security Researcher. While the code checks for absolute paths and prevents paths starting with '.' or '..', it lacks additional security measures such as canonicalization of file paths and input validation. This leaves the code partially vulnerable to directory traversal attacks, which could lead to unauthorized data disclosure or modification. It is recommended to enhance the path traversal protection to mitigate this risk."
