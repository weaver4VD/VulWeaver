        "justification": "The code does not perform proper bounds checking before copying data using memcpy, which can lead to buffer overflow. The Security Researcher's recommendation to validate the length specified in the header against the actual data size is crucial to prevent this vulnerability. The severity is high due to the potential impact of arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure."

        "justification": "The code lacks input validation checks for the AFI and SAFI values obtained from the capability message, which can result in memory corruption or information disclosure. The Security Researcher's suggestion to implement input validation checks is essential to mitigate this risk. The severity is medium as exploiting unvalidated input can lead to various security issues."
