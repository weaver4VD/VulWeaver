The recommended action is to remove or replace sensitive logging statements with more generic messages and implement access controls to restrict logging of sensitive information."

This could potentially lead to targeted attacks or exploitation of vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as it could aid attackers in crafting attacks. The recommended action is to adopt a more dynamic and configurable approach by using configuration files or external sources to store and retrieve operation names dynamically."
