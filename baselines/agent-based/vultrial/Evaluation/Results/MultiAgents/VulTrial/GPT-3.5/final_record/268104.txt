        "justification": "The vulnerability of Information Leakage is valid as sensitive information such as checkpoint paths is being logged using LOG(INFO), which can expose critical system details to potential attackers. The severity is considered medium as it can aid attackers in understanding the system architecture. To address this, the logging mechanism should be updated to filter out sensitive data or log at a higher level of abstraction."

        "justification": "The vulnerability of Unrestricted Logging is valid as there is a risk of exposing sensitive data due to unrestricted logging. The severity is considered low as it can lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. To mitigate this, a logging policy should be implemented that considers the sensitivity of the data being logged and uses different log levels to control the verbosity of logs."
