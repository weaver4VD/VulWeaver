        "justification": "The code snippet indeed lacks proper bounds checking when calculating the memory location for the 'value' pointer, which could potentially lead to buffer overflow. This vulnerability is partially valid because the impact of buffer overflow is severe, but the likelihood of exploitation depends on the specific conditions of memory allocation and usage. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by implementing proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks."
