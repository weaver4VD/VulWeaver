        "justification": "The code lacks proper input validation for the input index, which can lead to out-of-bounds access. Adding additional validation checks can mitigate the risk of crashes or security vulnerabilities. However, the existing validation for the input index is not completely absent, hence the partial validity."

        "justification": "The code indeed lacks proper memory management when copying ShapeHandles between contexts, which can result in memory corruption issues. Enhancing memory management practices, such as implementing reference counting or ownership tracking, is crucial to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities. The severity is high as memory corruption can lead to serious security risks."
