        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the risk of integer overflow exists due to potential unbounded calculations of 'num_elements_in_pooling_cell'. Proper validation and bounds checking on input values can mitigate this risk and prevent unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or crashes."

        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as unvalidated input in 'row_seq_tensor' and 'col_seq_tensor' could lead to out-of-bounds memory access or incorrect calculations. Implementing input validation checks to prevent negative values is recommended to ensure the correct behavior of tensor indexing."
