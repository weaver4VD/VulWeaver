        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code indeed has a potential buffer overflow due to lack of bounds checking when reading data into the 'data' array. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher to implement bounds checking is valid and should be fixed immediately to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities."
