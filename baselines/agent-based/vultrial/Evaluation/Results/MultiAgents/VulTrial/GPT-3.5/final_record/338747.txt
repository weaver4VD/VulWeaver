        "recommended_action": "monitor",
        "justification": "The code indeed uses proper bounds checking and memory allocation techniques to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Functions like ReadBlob and SetPixelIndex have checks in place to ensure data is read within the allocated memory space. The impact of this vulnerability is low, and it is recommended to monitor for any potential changes in the future."
