        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does not currently have a check to ensure that current_entry does not exceed the maximum size of the table before adding new entries, which could lead to buffer overflow. Adding this check is crucial to prevent writing beyond the boundaries of the table. The severity is considered medium as it could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even remote code execution. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately."
