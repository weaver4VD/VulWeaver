This can be achieved by adding a cleanup block before returning NULL in the error path. By freeing the memory before returning NULL, we ensure that no memory leaks occur even in error scenarios."

The code does indeed have a memory leak as the allocated memory for 'e' and 'ctx' is not freed in case of an error after allocation. This can lead to gradual depletion of available memory and potential system slowdown, instability, or denial of service. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher to add proper cleanup code is valid and should be implemented to fix the memory leak issue."
