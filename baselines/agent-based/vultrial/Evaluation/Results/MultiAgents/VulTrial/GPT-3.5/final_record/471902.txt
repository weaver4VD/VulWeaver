        "justification": "The identified vulnerability of buffer overflow is partially valid. The code allocates the 'line' variable with a fixed size of MAXWLEN + 2, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the content of ml_get_curline() exceeds this size. To address this, the 'line' variable should be dynamically allocated based on the actual length of the content retrieved from ml_get_curline to prevent buffer overflow."
