        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential vulnerability of unchecked pointer assignment in the code. The recommendation to add proper validation after assigning the pointer 'p' is valid to mitigate the risk of null pointer dereference. However, the severity is considered medium as it poses a risk of crashing the system. It is partially valid because the Security Researcher did not provide specific details on how to implement the validation, leaving room for interpretation by the Code Author."
