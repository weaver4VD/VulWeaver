        "justification": "The code does not perform proper input validation to check the length of input data before processing it, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The Security Researcher's mitigation suggestion aligns with best practices to prevent buffer overflow issues by implementing proper input validation, bounds checking, and input sanitization techniques."

        "justification": "The code lacks comprehensive input sanitization, which can result in parsing errors or unexpected behavior. Incomplete input sanitization can be exploited by attackers to inject malicious input and bypass security controls. It is crucial to implement proper input sanitization to mitigate security risks and ensure the integrity of the system."
