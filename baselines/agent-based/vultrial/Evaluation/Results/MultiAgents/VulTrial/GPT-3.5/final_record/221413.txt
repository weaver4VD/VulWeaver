The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy. However, the code still lacks proper initialization of 'intercept_smi', leading to a partially valid decision. To address this, the variable should be declared and properly initialized before being used to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure secure behavior."
