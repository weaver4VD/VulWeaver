        "justification": "The code indeed lacks proper bounds checking when copying data into the 'reason' buffer, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the packet size is larger than the buffer size. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. However, the Code Author has acknowledged the risk and suggested implementing proper bounds checking as a mitigation strategy. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a high severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately to prevent potential exploitation."
