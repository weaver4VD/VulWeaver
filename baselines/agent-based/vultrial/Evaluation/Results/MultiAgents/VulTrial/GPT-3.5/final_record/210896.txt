The proposed solution to add a check before the addition operation is valid and should be implemented to mitigate the risk of undefined behavior and security vulnerabilities."

This can expose sensitive memory slot information to attackers, compromising system security. The proposed solution to remove the call from the error handling code path is valid and should be implemented to prevent leakage of critical details."
