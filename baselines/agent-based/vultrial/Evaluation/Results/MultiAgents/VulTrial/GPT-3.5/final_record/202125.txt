        "justification": "The Review Board agrees with the Security Researcher that the code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the calculation of span length without proper bounds checking. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability could lead to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution. The Code Author's suggestion of implementing bounds checking is valid and should be fixed immediately to mitigate the risk of buffer overflow."
