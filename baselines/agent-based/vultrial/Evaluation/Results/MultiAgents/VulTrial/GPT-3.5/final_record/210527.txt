        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed mitigation strategies. However, the code still lacks proper bounds checking in the memcpy operation, which poses a high risk of arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. Immediate action is required to implement proper bounds checking and use safer functions like 'memcpy_s' to prevent buffer overflows."
