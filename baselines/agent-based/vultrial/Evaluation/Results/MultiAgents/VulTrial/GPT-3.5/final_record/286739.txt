        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the SWTPM_NVRAM_CheckHeader function due to the lack of validation for input data length. The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy to add a validation check. However, as the mitigation is not implemented yet, the vulnerability remains partially valid with a high severity. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent potential memory corruption and unauthorized code execution."
