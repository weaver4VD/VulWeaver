Instead of defaulting to 0777, consider setting more restrictive permissions based on the principle of least privilege. For example, using 0755 for directories to grant read and execute permissions to all users, but restrict write permissions to the owner only. This approach helps prevent unauthorized access or modifications to sensitive files within the created directories."

The code does allow the creation of directories with potentially insecure permissions based on the 'mode' parameter. However, the code also checks for the 'mode' parameter and sets default permissions to 0777 only if it is not specified. To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement input validation and restrict the 'mode' parameter to a more secure permission setting, as suggested by the Security Researcher."
