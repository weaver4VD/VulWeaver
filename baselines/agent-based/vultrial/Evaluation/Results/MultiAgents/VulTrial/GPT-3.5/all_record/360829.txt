By validating the input, the risk of triggering an integer overflow and out-of-bounds access can be reduced. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of the vulnerability could lead to information disclosure or arbitrary code execution. It is recommended to implement the suggested fix immediately to enhance the code's security."
