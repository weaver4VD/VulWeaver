        "reason": "The code contains conditional checks for m_ppDecodingMCU and m_ppUpsampler being NULL before allocating memory. However, it does not perform a similar check for m_pFrame before accessing its member functions. If m_pFrame is NULL, it can lead to a potential null pointer dereference when trying to access its member functions.",
        "impact": "If m_pFrame is unexpectedly NULL during execution, it can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably, leading to a denial of service or potential security vulnerabilities."

This can be achieved by adding a destructor or cleanup function that releases the allocated memory before the object is destroyed or goes out of scope."
