      "justification": "The identified memory leak vulnerability is valid as the memory allocated for 'bmp_colormap' using 'AcquireQuantumMemory' is not properly deallocated using 'RelinquishMagickMemory' after its usage, leading to a memory leak. Properly deallocating the memory after its usage is necessary to prevent memory leaks."

Validating the values before performing arithmetic operations is essential to prevent unexpected behavior or security issues."

Providing a proper format string when using this function is necessary to prevent potential security risks."
