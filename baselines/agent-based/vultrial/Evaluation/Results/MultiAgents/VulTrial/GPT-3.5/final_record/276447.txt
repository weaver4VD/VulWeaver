        "justification": "The code does have a potential Use-After-Free vulnerability due to the unnecessary call to result.release() after result->Unref(). This can lead to memory corruption or crashes. The Security Researcher's suggestion to remove the call to result.release() is valid. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact can be significant if exploited."
