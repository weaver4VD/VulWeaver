        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential lack of input validation in the code related to the 'size' parameter. Adding input validation checks on the 'size' parameter is crucial to prevent buffer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities. However, the code snippet provided by the Moderator does not show the actual implementation of input validation checks. Therefore, the vulnerability is considered partially valid with a medium severity, and it is recommended to fix this issue immediately by implementing proper input validation."
