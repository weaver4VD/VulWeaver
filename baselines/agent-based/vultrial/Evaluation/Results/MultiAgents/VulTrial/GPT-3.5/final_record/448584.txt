        "justification": "The code is indeed vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of 'fgets' without specifying the buffer size. This can lead to memory corruption and potential security risks. The suggested mitigation provided by the author is valid and should be implemented to limit the number of characters read into the buffer."
