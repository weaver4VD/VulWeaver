This can prevent buffer overflows and other memory-related vulnerabilities. Additionally, input validation and sanitization should be enforced to ensure data integrity and security.",

This may involve using lock hierarchies, avoiding nested locks, and implementing timeout mechanisms to handle lock contention. Proper synchronization techniques and deadlock detection mechanisms can also be employed to mitigate the risk of deadlocks.",

Proper error logging, recovery mechanisms, and resource cleanup should be implemented to prevent resource leaks and ensure predictable behavior in case of errors. Error codes and messages should be informative and actionable to assist in troubleshooting and debugging.",
