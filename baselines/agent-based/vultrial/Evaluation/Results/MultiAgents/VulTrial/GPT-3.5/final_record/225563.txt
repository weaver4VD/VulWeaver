The proposed mitigation strategy of adding validation checks for input size and pooling ratio values is valid and should be implemented to prevent potential memory corruption and crashes."

The proposed mitigation strategy of implementing boundary checks to validate indices is valid and should be applied to prevent unauthorized memory access and data corruption."
