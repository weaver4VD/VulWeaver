        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the code does not release memory for the unique_ptr objects a_float and b_float after their usage. This can lead to memory leaks, impacting performance and resource utilization. Adding explicit memory release by calling reset() on the unique_ptr objects is necessary to prevent memory leaks."

        "decision": "valid",
        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the code lacks proper error handling for dimension checks when transposing the matrix 'right'. This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes if the checks fail. Implementing additional error handling logic to handle such scenarios will improve the robustness of the code and prevent potential issues."
