        "justification": "The code does have a potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to accessing memory outside the bounds of the 'rp' array. Adding a boundary check at the beginning of the loop to prevent 'n' from going below 0 would partially address this issue. However, further analysis and improvements may be needed to fully mitigate the risk."

While the suggestion to add explicit checks is valid, additional measures may be required to ensure complete protection against integer overflow vulnerabilities."
