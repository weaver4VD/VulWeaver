The impact of this vulnerability could lead to security breaches, data leakage, or unauthorized access. The recommended action is to implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent malicious content injection."

This proactive stack check helps mitigate the risk of buffer overflows. The severity is low as the code already includes a preventive measure. It is recommended to monitor for any potential stack-based buffer overflow issues."
