        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does allow the creation of directories with potentially insecure permissions based on the 'mode' parameter. However, the code also checks for the 'mode' parameter and sets default permissions to 0777 only if it is not specified. To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement input validation and restrict the 'mode' parameter to a more secure permission setting, as suggested by the Security Researcher."
