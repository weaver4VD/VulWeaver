This could result in critical system files being overwritten or malicious content being injected. Immediate action is required to implement proper validation and restrict access to authorized directories."

        "justification": "The code constructs file paths based on user-controlled input without sufficient validation, making it susceptible to directory traversal attacks. This medium-severity vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive files or execute arbitrary code. Immediate action is needed to strengthen input validation, implement path normalization, and restrict access to sensitive directories."
