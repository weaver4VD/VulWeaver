        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the vulnerability of incomplete switch case handling in the evalUnaryOperator function. The lack of default cases in the switch statements can lead to potential vulnerabilities if unexpected operand kinds are encountered. Adding default cases to handle unexpected inputs is crucial for robustness. The Code Author's suggested mitigation aligns with best practices and should be implemented to address this vulnerability."
