The code does not implement proper bounds checking before reading entries into the local_access_entries and global_access_entries lists, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as it can potentially be exploited by attackers. The recommended action is to fix this issue immediately to prevent security risks."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The code lacks a cleanup mechanism to free the allocated memory for GF_AfraEntry and GF_GlobalAfraEntry structures in case of early returns due to error conditions, leading to memory leaks. The severity is low as it may not have immediate security implications but can impact memory management. The recommended action is to fix this issue immediately to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper memory management."
