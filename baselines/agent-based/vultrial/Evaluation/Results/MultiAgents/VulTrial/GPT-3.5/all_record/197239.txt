  "reason": "To mitigate the risk of memory corruption, the code should avoid using const_cast to remove the const qualifier from input_min_vec_data and input_max_vec_data. Instead, a non-const pointer should be used to access the data, ensuring that the original data remains unchanged. By refraining from modifying the input data directly, the code can prevent potential memory corruption issues."

This approach prevents integer overflow issues that may arise when dealing with large values. By utilizing floating-point calculations, the code ensures that the scaling factors are accurately computed without the risk of integer overflow, thereby maintaining the integrity of the computations."
