        "justification": "The code snippet does have a potential memory leak vulnerability as it continues without freeing memory if allocation fails. The Security Researcher's suggestion to add a check for successful memory allocation and free memory if allocation fails is valid. The severity is medium as memory leaks can degrade system performance and lead to instability or denial of service."
