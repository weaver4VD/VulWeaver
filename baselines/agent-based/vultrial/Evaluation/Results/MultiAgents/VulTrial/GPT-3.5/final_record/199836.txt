        "justification": "The code indeed lacks boundary checks before dereferencing the current pointer, making it vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks as identified by the Security Researcher. The suggested mitigation strategy by the Code Author aligns with best practices to prevent buffer overflows. However, since the code currently does not have these checks in place, it is considered partially valid. Adding boundary checks is crucial to prevent potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities."
