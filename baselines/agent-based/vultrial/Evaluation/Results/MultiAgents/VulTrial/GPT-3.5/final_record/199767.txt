        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. While the code does use unsafe string manipulation functions like 'strcpy' and 'strcat' which can lead to buffer overflow, the code does not directly expose the buffer to external input. However, to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks, it is recommended to replace 'strcpy' and 'strcat' with safer functions like 'strncpy' and 'strncat' to specify the maximum number of characters to copy, mitigating the risk of buffer overflow."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The 'tcp_sendf' function is indeed vulnerable to command injection if the input data is not properly sanitized. To address this vulnerability, input data should be thoroughly validated and sanitized before being passed to the 'tcp_sendf' function. Implementing strict input validation checks will help prevent unauthorized command injections and reduce the risk of security breaches."
