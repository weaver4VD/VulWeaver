        "severity": "medium",

        "justification": "The vulnerability of unrestricted memory access is partially valid as the code lacks proper boundary checks when accessing arrays and pointers like 'line' and 'lp'. This could lead to out-of-bounds memory access. Implementing boundary checks and ensuring all accesses are within allocated memory bounds will mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability of assertion bypass is valid as the code relies heavily on assertions without proper error handling mechanisms. This could allow attackers to bypass assertions and disrupt the program flow, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Implementing error handling strategies to gracefully handle assertion failures is crucial to maintain code stability and security."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability of no error handling is valid as the code lacks robust error handling mechanisms throughout the decoding process. This leaves the code vulnerable to unexpected conditions or failures during decoding, which could be exploited by attackers. Implementing proper exception handling, error logging, and recovery strategies will help mitigate the risk of denial of service, data corruption, or other security issues."
