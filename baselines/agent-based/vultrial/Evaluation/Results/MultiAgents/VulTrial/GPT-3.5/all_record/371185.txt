The code indeed allocates memory for 's1' and 's2' using malloc but does not free this memory in all error return paths, leading to potential memory leaks. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to add proper memory deallocation for 's1' and 's2' in all error return paths is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks."
