        "justification": "The code does indeed have a null pointer dereference vulnerability as identified by the Security Researcher. The proposed mitigation strategy by the Code Author to add null checks before accessing qo->maps is valid and would help prevent crashes or exploitation. However, since the mitigation is not implemented in the current code, the vulnerability remains partially valid. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent potential risks."
