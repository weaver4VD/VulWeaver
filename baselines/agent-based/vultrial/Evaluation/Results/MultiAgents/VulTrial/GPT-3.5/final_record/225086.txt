        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code uses a simple string comparison to check for unique attribute names, which can be exploited by attackers to bypass the uniqueness check. To mitigate this vulnerability, enhancing the comparison mechanism by converting all attribute names to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) before checking for uniqueness is recommended. This will prevent potential bypasses of the uniqueness check and enhance the overall security of the system."
