The proposed mitigation strategy by the Author to add memory deallocation is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks and potential performance issues."

The proposed mitigation strategy by the Author to add bounds checking for 'off' is valid and crucial to prevent exploitation by attackers and ensure data integrity."
