        "justification": "The code does use reinterpret_cast for type conversions, which can potentially lead to type confusion vulnerabilities as identified by the Security Researcher. However, the Security Researcher also provided a mitigation strategy to use safer type conversion methods such as static_cast or dynamic_cast. Implementing this mitigation would address the vulnerability and improve the code's security."
