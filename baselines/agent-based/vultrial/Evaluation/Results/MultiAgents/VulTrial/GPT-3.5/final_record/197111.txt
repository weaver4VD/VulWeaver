        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code does not have explicit bounds checking before accessing data_ptr after 'data_ptr += 20;', which could lead to a buffer overflow risk. Adding a check for data_len before accessing data_ptr can help mitigate this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The code does not handle large calculations involving data_width, data_height, and num_channels carefully, which could lead to integer overflow vulnerabilities. Implementing checks for potential overflow scenarios and using appropriate data types can help prevent unexpected behavior."
