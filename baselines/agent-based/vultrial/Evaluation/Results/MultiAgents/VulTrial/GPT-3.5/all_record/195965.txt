This can be achieved by validating the input data ranges and ensuring that the result of the operations does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type. Additionally, using data types with larger ranges or performing calculations in a way that avoids overflow, such as using safe arithmetic libraries, can help prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities."
