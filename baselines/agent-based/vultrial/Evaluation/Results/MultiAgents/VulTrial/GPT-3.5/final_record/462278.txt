The Code Author should add bounds checking to ensure the indices do not exceed the size of the input buffer to prevent buffer overflow. This is partially valid as the vulnerability was correctly identified, but the severity is medium due to the potential impact of memory corruption, crashes, or remote code execution."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential integer underflow vulnerability by not properly validating the length value before the string copy operation. The Code Author should implement more robust validation to ensure the length value is within a valid range. This is partially valid as the vulnerability was correctly identified, but the severity is medium due to the potential impact of incorrect memory operations, data corruption, or unexpected behavior in the application."
