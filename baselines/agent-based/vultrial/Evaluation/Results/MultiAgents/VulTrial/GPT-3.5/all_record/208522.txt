Additionally, proper boundary checks should be implemented when copying data into 'rr' to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

This routine should free any allocated memory to prevent memory leaks. Implementing proper error handling and cleanup mechanisms will ensure that memory resources are managed efficiently and prevent memory leaks over time.",
