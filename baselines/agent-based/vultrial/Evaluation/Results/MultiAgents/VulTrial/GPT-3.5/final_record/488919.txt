        "justification": "The identified buffer overflow vulnerability is partially valid. The Security Researcher correctly pointed out the risk of buffer overflow due to unchecked input size. The code should indeed validate 'authkey->sca_keylength' against 'optlen - sizeof(struct sctp_authkey)' to prevent buffer overflows. This vulnerability poses a medium severity risk as it could potentially lead to code execution. Immediate action is recommended to fix this issue."
