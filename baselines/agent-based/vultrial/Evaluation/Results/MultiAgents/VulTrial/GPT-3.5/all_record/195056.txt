The Security Researcher correctly pointed out the loop condition 'i <= bias_size - 16' as a potential buffer overflow risk. Changing it to 'i < bias_size - 16' would indeed mitigate the issue by preventing reading beyond the bounds of the bias_data array. However, further analysis is needed to ensure there are no other similar vulnerabilities in the code."
