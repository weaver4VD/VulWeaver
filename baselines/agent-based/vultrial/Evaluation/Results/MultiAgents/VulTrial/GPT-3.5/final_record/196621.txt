        "justification": "The code does not have proper validation before accessing the 'mt' field of the 'c' struct, which could lead to memory corruption. Adding validation checks to ensure 'c' is properly initialized and bounds checking can help mitigate this vulnerability. However, the code does not address the risk of dangling pointers, which is essential for preventing out-of-bound memory access."

        "justification": "The code directly exposes the method name 'mid' in the error message, which can lead to information disclosure. Using generic error messages and logging detailed messages internally can help prevent leaking sensitive information. By implementing these changes, the code can reduce the risk of attackers gaining insights into the application's internal workings."
