        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer over-read vulnerability due to the while loop condition allowing 'p' to go beyond the buffer bounds. The proposed mitigation by modifying the loop condition is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer over-read issues."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential integer underflow is refuted by the fact that the expression (size_t)(p - parser->end) is correctly cast to size_t, preventing any underflow. Therefore, there is no actual vulnerability in this context, and no action is needed."
