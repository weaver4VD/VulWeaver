        "justification": "The code does have a potential memory leak as identified by the Security Researcher. The Security Researcher's suggestion to implement proper memory management by adding cleanup code before each 'goto exit' statement is valid. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of repeated execution without proper memory management could lead to memory exhaustion. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any potential crashes or unresponsiveness."
