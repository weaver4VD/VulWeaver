        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability due to the inaccurate calculation of 'rrlen' and lack of proper boundary checks when copying data into 'rr'. The Code Author also acknowledged this vulnerability and proposed mitigation strategies. By adjusting the calculation of 'rrlen', implementing proper boundary checks, and using safer functions like 'snprintf', the code can be safeguarded against buffer overflow vulnerabilities. However, the code still needs to be updated to address these issues, hence the verdict of partially valid with a high severity."

        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the memory leak issue in the code. The Code Author should add a cleanup routine before returning in case of memory allocation failure to free any allocated memory and prevent memory leaks. Implementing proper error handling and cleanup mechanisms will ensure efficient memory management and prevent memory leaks over time. The impact of memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. Therefore, the verdict is valid with a medium severity."
