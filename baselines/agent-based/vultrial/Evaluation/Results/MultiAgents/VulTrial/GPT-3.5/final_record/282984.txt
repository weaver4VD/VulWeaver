The Code Author acknowledged the issue and provided a mitigation strategy to add additional checks. While the mitigation approach is valid, it was not fully implemented in the code, hence the decision is partially valid.

The proposed mitigation by adding a conditional check is valid but not fully implemented in the code. Therefore, the decision is partially valid. The severity is medium as it can lead to crashes and denial of service (DoS) attacks."
