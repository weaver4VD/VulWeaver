        "justification": "The code does have potential memory leak issues as identified by the Security Researcher. The memory allocated for 'result' and 'infos' is not freed before returning NULL in the 'beach' label, which can lead to memory exhaustion over time. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher to add a cleanup step before returning NULL is valid and should be implemented to ensure proper memory management."
