        "severity": "low",
        "recommended_action": "monitor",

        "justification": "While the code does not currently have explicit checks for integer overflow, implementing additional checks for large inputs can help mitigate the risk. By ensuring that input sizes are within acceptable limits, the impact of potential integer overflow can be reduced. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to enhance the stability of the program."

        "justification": "Although the code does not have explicit bounds checking for memory allocation, implementing limits based on input size or available resources can help prevent excessive memory usage. By addressing this issue promptly, the risk of memory corruption or denial of service attacks can be mitigated."
