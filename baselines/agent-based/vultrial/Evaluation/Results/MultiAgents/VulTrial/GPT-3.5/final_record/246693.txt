The severity is medium as memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion over time. The recommended action is to fix it immediately by adding code to free the allocated memory for GF_AfraEntry and GF_GlobalAfraEntry structures after their usage."

The Code Author also acknowledged this vulnerability and provided a refutation explaining the guard check in place. The severity is low as the code handles the division by zero scenario effectively. The recommended action is to monitor this part of the code to ensure the guard check continues to prevent integer overflow."
