The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of adding a length check is appropriate, but it should be implemented to fully address the vulnerability and prevent memory corruption or arbitrary code execution."

        "justification": "The potential information disclosure vulnerability is valid as the Security Researcher highlighted the risk of logging unknown attribute types. While the Code Author refuted this concern, it is important to monitor and potentially review the logging mechanism to ensure that no sensitive information is inadvertently exposed, even if the immediate impact is low."
