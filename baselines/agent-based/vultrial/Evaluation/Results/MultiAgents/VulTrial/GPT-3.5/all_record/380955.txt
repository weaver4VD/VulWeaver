security_researcher: The identified vulnerabilities in the given code snippet are as follows:

1. **Buffer Overflow**:
   - **Reason**: The vulnerability arises due to the `cpc` array, which is used to store composing characters. If the number of composing characters exceeds the size of the `cpc` array (`MAX_MCO`), a buffer overflow can occur.
   - **Impact**: Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to memory corruption, crashes, or potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

2. **Arbitrary Memory Write**:
   - **Reason**: The vulnerability exists in the `del_char` function where memory writes are performed without proper bounds checking. This can lead to arbitrary memory write operations, potentially overwriting critical data structures or code.
   - **Impact**: Exploiting this vulnerability can result in memory corruption, instability, and may allow attackers to manipulate program behavior or execute arbitrary code.

It is recommended to implement proper bounds checking, validation of memory operations, and consider using safer data structures to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
