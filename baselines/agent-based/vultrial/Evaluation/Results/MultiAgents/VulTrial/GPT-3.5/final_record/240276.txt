        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to the lack of bounds checking. The Code Author also acknowledged the risk and proposed a mitigation strategy. However, since the bounds checking is not implemented in the current code, the vulnerability still exists. It is crucial to implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow attacks."
