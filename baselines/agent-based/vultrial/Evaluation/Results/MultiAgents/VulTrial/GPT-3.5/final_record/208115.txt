The suggested mitigation of adding a free_netdev(ndev) call in the error handling path is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks. The impact of this vulnerability on system stability and denial of service is significant, hence the severity is medium."

The Security Researcher's concern about resource leaks is not applicable in this case. Therefore, the vulnerability of resource leak is invalid. No action is needed as the code already handles resource allocation and release correctly."
