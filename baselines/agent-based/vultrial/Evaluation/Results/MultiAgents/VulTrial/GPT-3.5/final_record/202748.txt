This can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The suggested mitigation of implementing proper bounds checking is valid and should be fixed immediately."

The suggested mitigation of freeing the 'comment' memory after it is no longer needed is valid and should be fixed immediately to prevent memory exhaustion and denial of service issues."
