However, the code still lacks bounds checking before writing data to the usb_msg structure, which could lead to memory corruption. Implementing bounds checking is crucial to prevent buffer overflows."

Setting the ctx pointer to NULL after freeing memory is essential to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory management. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."
