        "justification": "The code indeed lacks proper input validation on the 'src' path, which could lead to path traversal attacks. However, the code author's suggestion to use functions like 'realpath' for input validation aligns with best practices and can help mitigate the vulnerability. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
