The Code Author's response to mitigate the issue by implementing resource usage limits is valid. However, the Code Author did not mention the impact of attackers consuming excessive resources leading to denial of service. Therefore, the verdict is partially valid with a medium severity, and immediate action is recommended to fix the resource exhaustion vulnerability."
