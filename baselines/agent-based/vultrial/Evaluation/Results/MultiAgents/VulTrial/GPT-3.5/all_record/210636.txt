The proposed mitigation strategy by the Code Author to set 'ax' to NULL after freeing the memory is valid and should be implemented to prevent potential crashes or arbitrary code execution. The severity is considered medium as exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a crash of the program or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code."
