        "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the code indeed does not limit the number of file descriptors that can be opened, potentially leading to resource exhaustion. The proposed mitigation strategy of implementing a mechanism to limit file descriptors and ensuring proper closure aligns with best practices. However, the severity is medium as the impact could lead to a denial of service attack. Immediate action is recommended to prevent exploitation."

        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the code does not free the allocated memory for 'servinfo' in all error scenarios, which can result in memory leaks. The proposed mitigation strategy of freeing memory in all error scenarios is essential to prevent memory exhaustion and system instability. The severity is medium due to the gradual increase in memory consumption over time. Immediate action is advised to address this vulnerability."
