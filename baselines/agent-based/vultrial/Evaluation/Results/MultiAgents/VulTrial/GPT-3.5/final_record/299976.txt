The Code Author also acknowledged this issue and provided a mitigation strategy. However, the suggested code change was not implemented in the code snippet provided, making it only partially valid. The severity is considered medium as it can lead to memory exhaustion and potential denial of service."

The Code Author also acknowledged this issue and provided a mitigation strategy. The severity is considered high as exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a crash, data corruption, or potentially code execution."
