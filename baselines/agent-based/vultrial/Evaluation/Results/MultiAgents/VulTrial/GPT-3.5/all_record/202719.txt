The calculation of 'outlen' and 'inlen' indeed does not include the size of 'stream_list', which can lead to a buffer overflow. The impact of this vulnerability could be severe, potentially leading to memory corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution. The suggested mitigation provided by the Security Researcher is valid and should be implemented to fix this vulnerability immediately."
