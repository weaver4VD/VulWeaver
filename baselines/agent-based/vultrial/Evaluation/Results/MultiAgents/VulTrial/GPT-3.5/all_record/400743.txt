The suggested mitigation strategy of adding a check before the calculation is valid and can prevent the overflow. However, the implementation of this check was not explicitly shown in the code provided. Therefore, the vulnerability is considered partially valid with a medium severity, and it is recommended to fix it immediately to ensure program stability and security."
