The code lacks proper bounds checking to ensure that the BYE reason does not exceed the allocated buffer size. The suggested mitigation provided by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
