The impact of a buffer overflow can be severe, leading to arbitrary code execution or unauthorized access. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by implementing proper bounds checking and validation of input data."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid as the calculation '16 + 8 * tool_num' could result in integer overflow for large values of 'tool_num'. An integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by reviewing the calculation and implementing appropriate data types or bounds checking to prevent overflow."
