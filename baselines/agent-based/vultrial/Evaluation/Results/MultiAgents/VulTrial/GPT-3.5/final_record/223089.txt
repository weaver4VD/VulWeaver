The Code Author provided a mitigation strategy to implement proper bounds checking and use safer functions like 'snprintf'. However, the code still lacks these measures, so immediate action is needed to address this vulnerability to prevent potential exploitation."

The Code Author suggested validating and sanitizing file paths, but these measures are not implemented in the code. Immediate action is required to address this vulnerability and prevent unauthorized file access."

The Code Author recommended sanitizing user-controlled data, but this safeguard is not present in the code. It is crucial to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent potential command injection attacks."
