This can lead to an integer overflow if 'size' is a negative value, resulting in alloc_size being incorrectly calculated and potentially causing memory corruption or unexpected behavior.",

This could lead to allocating a smaller buffer than intended, resulting in a buffer overflow vulnerability or other memory-related issues."

This can be achieved by adding a simple conditional statement to verify that 'size' is greater than or equal to 0 before proceeding with the calculation."
