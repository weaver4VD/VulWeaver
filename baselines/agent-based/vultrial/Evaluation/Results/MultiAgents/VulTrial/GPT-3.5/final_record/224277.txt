        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The potential memory leak identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The code lacks proper cleanup handling for the 'seccomp' filter context, which can lead to memory leaks when the context goes out of scope. Implementing the cleanup function 'cleanup_seccomp' is crucial to free the allocated memory and prevent memory leaks. The severity is considered medium as memory leaks can impact performance and resource consumption. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Incomplete Error Handling vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The code lacks comprehensive error handling, especially in scenarios like adding seccomp rules or exporting BPF data. Proper error management is essential to ensure robustness and reliability. The severity is medium as incomplete error handling can lead to security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior. Immediate action is advised to revise the code and address this vulnerability."
