        "justification": "The Security Researcher identified a potential buffer overflow risk due to the use of memcpy. While memcpy is safer than strcpy, the code lacks bounds checking to ensure data size does not exceed buffer size. Implementing bounds checking will mitigate the risk of buffer overflow."
