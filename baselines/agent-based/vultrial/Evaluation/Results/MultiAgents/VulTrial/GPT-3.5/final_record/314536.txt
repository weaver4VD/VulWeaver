        "justification": "The code indeed lacks proper bounds checking before writing data into the buffer, which can lead to a buffer overflow. The Security Researcher's suggestion to implement bounds checking and use safer functions like 'snprintf' is valid. However, the code author's perspective of using 'pj_memcpy' for buffer manipulation may also be considered. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a high severity, and immediate action is recommended."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential integer overflow risk due to improper buffer length comparison. The suggested mitigation strategies align with best practices to prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities. Therefore, the vulnerability is valid with a medium severity, and immediate action is recommended."
