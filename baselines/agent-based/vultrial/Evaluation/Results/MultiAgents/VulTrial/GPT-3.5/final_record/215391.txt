        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to the use of 'sizeof' to determine the size of the 'err_str' array. The impact of this vulnerability could lead to buffer overflow and arbitrary code execution. The Code Author also acknowledged the vulnerability and proposed a mitigation strategy using safer string functions. However, the code still remains partially vulnerable as the suggested mitigation has not been implemented yet."
