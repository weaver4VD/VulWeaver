        "justification": "The code snippet indeed frees memory pointed to by sp->rbuff and sp->xbuff using kfree without setting the pointers to NULL, which can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability. Setting the pointers to NULL after freeing the memory would mitigate this vulnerability and should be fixed immediately."
