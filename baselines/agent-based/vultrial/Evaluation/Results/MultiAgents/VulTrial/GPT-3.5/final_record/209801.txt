The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy. However, the code still lacks explicit initialization of 'minify' before being used, leaving room for exploitation. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
