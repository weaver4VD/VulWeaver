        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the risk of unbounded memory allocation due to the lack of bounds checking for 'k'. The suggested mitigation of adding a conditional check is valid and should be implemented to prevent potential denial of service attacks. However, the severity is considered medium as it could lead to resource exhaustion. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."

The suggested mitigation of implementing proper error handling and timeout mechanisms is valid and essential to prevent denial of service risks. The severity is medium as it could lead to unresponsive threads. Immediate action is recommended to improve mutex handling in the code."
