        "justification": "The Security Researcher's suggestion to add a check to ensure that the input handle is not null is valid and will help mitigate the risk of null pointer dereference. However, the code snippet provided by the Moderator already includes a check for null session state, which shows some level of awareness of potential null pointers. Therefore, the code is partially valid as it addresses part of the vulnerability but can be improved further."
