The Security Researcher's recommendation to implement bounds checking is crucial to prevent buffer overflow.

        "justification": "The vulnerability of uncontrolled memory allocation is valid as the code does not validate the size of memory allocation for 'page', which could result in excessive memory consumption. The Security Researcher's recommendation to implement checks for reasonable limits is essential to prevent DoS attacks or system instability. The severity is high due to the potential impact on system stability and security."
