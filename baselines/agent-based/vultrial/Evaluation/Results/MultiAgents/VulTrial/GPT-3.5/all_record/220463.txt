The Security Researcher's concern about memory not being released after allocation is valid. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to add a destructor or cleanup mechanism is a valid approach to address the issue. However, the Code Author's response also provides a valid mitigation strategy to implement proper memory management practices. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately by implementing the suggested mitigation strategies."
