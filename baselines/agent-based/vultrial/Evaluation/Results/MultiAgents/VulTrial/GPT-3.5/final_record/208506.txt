The severity is high because exploiting this vulnerability can result in crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution. The recommended action is to implement proper bounds checking using safe string functions like strncpy or snprintf to prevent buffer overflow."

            "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as memory allocated for certain strings is not freed in case of errors, leading to memory leaks. The severity is medium as memory leaks can result in excessive memory consumption over time. The recommended action is to ensure that memory allocated for tpn, dpn, and krbtgt_out_n is properly freed before returning from the function in case of an error and implement cleanup routines to release allocated memory resources."
