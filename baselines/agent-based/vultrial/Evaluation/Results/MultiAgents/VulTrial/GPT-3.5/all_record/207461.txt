    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified two vulnerabilities in the code: Buffer Overflow and Integer Overflow. The Buffer Overflow vulnerability arises from improper bounds checking when reading the BMP file header, which could lead to arbitrary code execution and memory corruption. The Integer Overflow vulnerability occurs in calculating rowbytes, where proper validation and handling of integer calculations are needed to prevent security issues.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the vulnerabilities and provided a mitigation strategy for each. For the Buffer Overflow vulnerability, they recommended implementing proper bounds checking to validate input data and prevent memory corruption. Similarly, for the Integer Overflow vulnerability, they suggested implementing proper validation and handling of integer calculations to mitigate the risk."
