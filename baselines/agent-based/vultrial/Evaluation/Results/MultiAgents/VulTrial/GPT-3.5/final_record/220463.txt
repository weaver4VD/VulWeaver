        "justification": "The code snippet does indeed have a memory leak vulnerability as identified by the Security Researcher. The Security Researcher's concern about memory not being released after allocation is valid. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to add a destructor or cleanup mechanism is a valid approach to address the issue. However, the Code Author's response also provides a valid mitigation strategy to implement proper memory management practices. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately by implementing the suggested mitigation strategies."
