        "justification": "The vulnerability of memory corruption is valid as the code lacks proper bounds checking when copying data to the destination buffer. This could lead to buffer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to manipulate memory contents. The severity is high as it can lead to critical data structure overwrites. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential memory corruption."

        "justification": "The information leakage vulnerability is valid as the code does not handle sensitive information securely during the encryption process. This could lead to exposure of plaintext length and AAD length, resulting in confidentiality breaches. The severity is medium as it can lead to potential data leaks. Immediate action is recommended to enhance sensitive information handling."

        "justification": "The cryptographic weakness vulnerability is valid as the code makes fixed assumptions about IV length, potentially weakening the encryption process. This could lead to IV reuse attacks or other cryptographic vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as it can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data. Immediate action is recommended to validate IV lengths securely."
