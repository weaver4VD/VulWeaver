The Code Author's suggested mitigation approach of comparing absolute paths is a valid step towards addressing the issue, but it may not fully prevent all directory traversal scenarios. Therefore, the code needs immediate fixing with additional input validation measures."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about the vulnerability to symbolic link injection attacks is valid, as the originalFilePath is not properly validated. The Code Author's mitigation suggestion of validating the originalFilePath is a step in the right direction, but it may not cover all possible attack vectors. Therefore, immediate fixing of the code with enhanced validation checks is necessary to prevent potential attacks."
