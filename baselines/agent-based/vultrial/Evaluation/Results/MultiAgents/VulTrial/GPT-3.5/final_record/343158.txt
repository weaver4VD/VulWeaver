The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy to implement proper bounds checking. However, the severity is considered medium as exploiting this vulnerability can still lead to memory corruption and crashes. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential risks."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the Security Researcher correctly pointed out the dynamic memory allocation without proper validation. The Code Author acknowledged the issue and suggested adding validation and limits to the memory allocation process. The severity is considered high due to the potential impact of resource exhaustion and denial of service attacks. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities."
