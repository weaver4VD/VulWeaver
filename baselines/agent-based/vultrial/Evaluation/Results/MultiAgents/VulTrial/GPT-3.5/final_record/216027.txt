        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the COPY_BUF macro due to the lack of bounds checking. The proposed mitigation from the Code Author to add a check for buffer overflow is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory corruption and other security risks."
