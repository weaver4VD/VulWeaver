        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to using a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking. The suggested mitigation of using 'vsnprintf' with a dynamically allocated buffer is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow. However, the severity is high as the current implementation poses a significant risk of arbitrary code execution or denial of service."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about the double va_start calls is invalid as it was a typographical error in the code snippet. The Code Author's response of refutation is correct, and the issue can be easily fixed by removing the redundant va_start call. This issue does not pose a security vulnerability and no further action is needed."
