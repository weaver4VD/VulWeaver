        "justification": "The code lacks proper boundary checks and validation when accessing memory locations within the buffer, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. This poses a high risk as it can allow attackers to overwrite critical data, execute arbitrary code, or crash the application. Immediate action is required to implement proper boundary checks and prevent buffer overflow exploits."
