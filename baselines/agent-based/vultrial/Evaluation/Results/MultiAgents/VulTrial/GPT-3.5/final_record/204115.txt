        "justification": "The code lacks thorough input sanitization techniques, allowing for incomplete validation of input data. This can result in parsing errors and incorrect behavior, with a medium severity impact. Addressing this issue by implementing comprehensive input validation and sanitization techniques is crucial to prevent exploitation by an attacker."
