This can result in a gradual consumption of system memory over time. The suggested mitigation by the Code Author to add a call to 'cbor_decref(&att_cert)' at the appropriate location is valid and should be implemented to fix the memory leak issue."

The suggested mitigation by the Code Author to sanitize or generalize sensitive error messages is valid and should be implemented to prevent revealing implementation details that could aid attackers in crafting targeted attacks."
