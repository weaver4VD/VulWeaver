        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the vulnerability of uninitialized memory in the code. The recommendation to initialize the entire object, including its attributes, is valid. However, the Code Author's response to uncomment the line that initializes the object attributes using MemorySet(&object->attributes, 0, sizeof(OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES)); is only a partial solution. It is important to also initialize the entire object using MemorySet(object, 0, sizeof(*object)) to fully mitigate the vulnerability."
