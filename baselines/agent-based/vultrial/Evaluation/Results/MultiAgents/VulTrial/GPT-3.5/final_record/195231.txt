The severity is medium as it can lead to memory corruption and potential security risks. The recommended action is to add boundary checks before the memcpy operation to prevent buffer overflows."

This could lead to resource leaks and denial of service scenarios. The severity is high as it can disrupt the normal operation of the program.

The severity is medium as it can lead to security breaches and system compromise. The recommended action is to implement input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent security issues caused by malicious input."
