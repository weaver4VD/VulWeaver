        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The suggested mitigation to set 'ax->tty' to NULL before freeing 'ax->dev' is crucial in preventing use-after-free scenarios. However, the code snippet provided in the review does not show this specific mitigation in place. Therefore, it is recommended to implement the suggested mitigation to fully address the vulnerability."
