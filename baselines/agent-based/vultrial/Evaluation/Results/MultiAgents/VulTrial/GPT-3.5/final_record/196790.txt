        "justification": "The code does contain a comparison that could lead to an integer overflow vulnerability if example_weights.size() is a very large value. The Security Researcher's concern about potential security risks is valid. However, the Code Author's suggestion to mitigate the risk by handling the comparison in a safer way is also valid. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to implement the suggested mitigation approach."
