        "justification": "The code indeed lacks bounds checking before accessing the 'edid_blob' array using the 'reg' index, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. The Author also acknowledges the need for bounds checking. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid. The severity is medium as it could lead to potential security risks. The recommended action is to fix immediately by implementing bounds checking."
