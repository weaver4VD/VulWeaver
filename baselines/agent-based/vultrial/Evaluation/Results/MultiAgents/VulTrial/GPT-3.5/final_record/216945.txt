However, the impact of this vulnerability is medium as it can lead to memory exhaustion and potential slowdowns. The recommended action is to fix this issue by deallocating memory for 'eq' object using 'delete' keyword after its use."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher identified a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability, but the code already includes a check 'if (right_item)' to ensure that 'right_item' is not NULL before dereferencing it. This check protects against null pointer dereference issues, making the vulnerability valid but with low severity. No action is needed as the code is already safeguarded."
