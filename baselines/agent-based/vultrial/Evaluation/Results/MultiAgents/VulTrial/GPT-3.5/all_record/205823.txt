        "reason": "To mitigate the risk of incomplete input validation on the 'dl_type' parameter, it is recommended to add additional checks and validation logic before using it in the comparison operation. This can include range checks, type validation, and input sanitization to prevent malicious input.",

        "reason": "To address the incomplete input validation on the 'zone' parameter, it is advisable to implement thorough validation checks before passing it to the 'ipf_handle_frag' function. This can involve validating the range, type, and context of the 'zone' parameter to prevent unauthorized operations.",

This can help prevent manipulation and ensure the integrity of the hash calculation process.",
