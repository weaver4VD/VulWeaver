        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the lack of proper input validation and sanitization in the code, which can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities. The Code Author's response acknowledges the need for mitigation measures, but the severity remains medium as the suggested actions were not implemented in the code. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher raised concerns about unhandled exceptions due to the 'ret' variable not being handled for all possible return values. The Code Author's response effectively refuted this by explaining the error handling mechanisms in place. The severity is low as the code includes appropriate error handling. Monitoring the code for any potential exceptions is recommended."
