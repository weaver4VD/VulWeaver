The code lacks an authorization check before allowing the table to be dropped, which could lead to unauthorized users dropping tables and potential data loss or service disruption. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher aligns with best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to implement an authorization check to verify user privileges before allowing table drops."
