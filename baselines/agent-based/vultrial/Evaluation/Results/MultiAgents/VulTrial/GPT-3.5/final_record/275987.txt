The Code Author also acknowledged this vulnerability and recommended using a more secure random number generation function. However, as the current code still uses a potentially weak RNG function, immediate action is needed to replace it with a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) to enhance the randomness and security of cryptographic operations."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the side-channel attack vulnerability in the code, which could lead to information leakage through timing or power consumption variations. The Code Author also acknowledged this vulnerability and proposed implementing countermeasures. To address this high-severity vulnerability effectively, immediate action is required to implement countermeasures such as constant-time algorithms, data-independent execution paths, and secure coding practices to minimize information leakage through side channels and protect the confidentiality and integrity of cryptographic operations."
