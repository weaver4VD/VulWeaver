The Security Researcher correctly pointed out the potential buffer overflow in the NEON section of the code due to improper boundary checks. The impact of this vulnerability could lead to memory corruption or crashes. The recommended action is to add proper boundary checks within the loop logic to prevent accessing memory beyond the bounds of the bias_data array."
