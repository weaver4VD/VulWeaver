The Security Researcher's concern is valid as it can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher is appropriate to add a check to ensure 'offs' does not exceed UINT32_MAX divided by 4. This would help mitigate the risk of integer overflow and prevent potential exploitation by attackers."
