This can result in overwriting adjacent memory locations and potential security risks. The severity is high due to the potential impact on system stability and security. Immediate action is recommended to implement bounds checking and prevent buffer overflow."

            "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as arithmetic operations on 'shift.red', 'shift.green', 'shift.blue', and 'shift.opacity' are not validated, leading to potential integer overflow. This can result in unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as it can impact data integrity and system reliability. Immediate action is recommended to validate arithmetic operations and prevent integer overflow."

While the impact is low in the short term, memory leaks can affect system performance over time. Immediate action is recommended to implement proper memory deallocation and prevent resource exhaustion."
