        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about incomplete switch case handling is valid as the switch statement in the gen_assignment function does not cover all possible values of the 'type' variable. This could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. A medium severity is assigned as it can impact the code execution flow. Immediate action is recommended to address this issue."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's identification of unrestricted access to memory is partially valid. While the code lacks proper bounds checking and validation, the Code Author suggested mitigation strategies to address this vulnerability. A high severity is assigned due to the potential risks of buffer overflows and memory corruption. Monitoring the implementation of bounds checking and validation is recommended to prevent memory-related vulnerabilities."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential use-after-free vulnerabilities is partially valid. The Code Author provided mitigation strategies for strong memory management practices to prevent such scenarios. A high severity is assigned as use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption and unauthorized access. Monitoring the implementation of robust memory management techniques is advised to mitigate this risk."
