        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential for an integer overflow in the code due to the calculation 'left -= PAGE_SIZE - off;'. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The suggested mitigation from the Author to add a check to ensure 'left' does not become negative is valid and should be implemented to prevent the vulnerability. The severity is medium as an integer overflow could lead to memory corruption or crashes."
