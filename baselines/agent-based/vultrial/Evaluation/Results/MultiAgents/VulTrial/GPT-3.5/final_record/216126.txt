        "justification": "The code does have a potential memory leak as identified by the Security Researcher. The allocated memory for 'krb5context', 'krb5keytab', 'princ', and 'entry' may not be properly deallocated in case of early exits via 'goto exit'. This can lead to memory leaks, especially in long-running processes or loops. The suggested mitigation provided by the Security Researcher is valid and should be implemented to ensure proper memory deallocation."
