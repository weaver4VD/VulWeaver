This includes validating the contents of 'input_min_range' and 'input_max_range' tensors to ensure they do not contain sensitive data. Additionally, access to these tensors should be restricted to authorized entities only, and proper data sanitization techniques should be applied."

This vulnerability has a high severity as it could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing proper input validation and access control mechanisms as suggested by the Security Researcher."
