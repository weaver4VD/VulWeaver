The Security Researcher's recommendation to include a destructor or cleanup function is valid and should be implemented to mitigate the vulnerability. This is a partially valid vulnerability as the code lacks proper memory management."

The Security Researcher's recommendation to include bounds checking is valid and crucial to prevent unauthorized memory access. This vulnerability is valid and requires immediate action to enhance security."
