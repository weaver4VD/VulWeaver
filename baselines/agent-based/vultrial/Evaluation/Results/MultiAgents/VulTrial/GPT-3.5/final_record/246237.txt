The suggested mitigation of using snprintf with buffer size management is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow attacks."

The calculation involving sel1XSum and sel2XSum is based on constrained values, eliminating the risk of integer overflow. Therefore, there is no impact or need for action in this context."
