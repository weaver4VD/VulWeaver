While the recommendation to add bounds checking is valid and important for preventing buffer overflow attacks, the code snippet provided does not clearly show whether such bounds checking is already implemented or not. Therefore, it is recommended to review the actual implementation in the code and ensure that proper bounds checking is in place to address this vulnerability."
