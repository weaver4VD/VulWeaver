However, the specific implementation details or code changes to address this issue are not provided. The severity is considered medium as buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential exploits."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's identified Integer Overflow vulnerability is valid as the code lacks proper validation and handling of the 'mtu' value, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The severity is considered medium as integer overflows can result in crashes or security vulnerabilities. Immediate action is recommended to address this risk."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's identified Memory Leak vulnerability is valid as the code does not properly clean up memory resources in case of 'tipc_msg_skb_clone' failure. The severity is considered low, but immediate action is still recommended to prevent memory leaks and potential performance degradation. Implementing a cleanup mechanism is crucial to address this issue."
