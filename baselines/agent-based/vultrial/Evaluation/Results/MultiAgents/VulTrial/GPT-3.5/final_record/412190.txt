The Code Author provided a mitigation strategy to address this by implementing proper input validation and sanitization.

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the vulnerability in the code related to Arbitrary Code Execution, as expressions from user input are evaluated without proper validation. The Code Author provided a mitigation strategy to address this by restricting the evaluation of expressions to trusted sources and implementing strict input validation. However, the code does not currently enforce these restrictions, making it only partially valid. The severity is considered medium as the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access and system compromise."
