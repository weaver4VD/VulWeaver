        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to potential unchecked buffer size when reading data into the 'temp' buffer. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service. The suggested mitigation of checking 'bn_size' before reading data is crucial to prevent this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher accurately pointed out the file descriptor leak vulnerability in the code, which could lead to resource exhaustion or potential security risks. Closing the file descriptor 'fd' in all error handling paths is essential to prevent this issue. Immediate action is recommended to avoid these risks."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly highlighted the incomplete error handling vulnerability, which could result in memory leaks and resource exhaustion. Ensuring proper resource cleanup, like freeing memory allocated for 'name', in all error paths is necessary. While the impact is lower compared to other vulnerabilities, fixing this issue immediately is still recommended."
