While the risk of buffer overflow is correctly pointed out, the Code Author has already taken some measures to prevent it by calculating the size of 'stream_list' and adding it to the chunk based on available space. However, it is important to ensure that the size of 'stream_list' is always within the bounds of the chunk buffer to fully mitigate the risk. Therefore, the code should be reviewed to add additional checks to validate the size of 'stream_list' before copying it to the chunk."
