        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as there is no check to verify if the returned pointer 't' is NULL before accessing its members, which could result in a null pointer dereference. The severity is high as it could lead to a crash or denial of service. The recommended action is to fix this issue immediately by adding a check after the ip6gre_tunnel_lookup function call to prevent null pointer dereference."
