    "reason": "To mitigate the arbitrary file read vulnerability, proper input validation should be implemented before opening the file. Validate the 'Run.files.log' variable to ensure it points to a legitimate log file within the expected directory structure. Additionally, consider restricting access to only specific directories where log files are stored to limit the potential impact of an attack."

    "reason": "To address the incomplete input validation issue, implement robust input validation mechanisms for the 'Run.files.log' variable. Validate the input to ensure it does not contain any unauthorized characters or sequences that could lead to directory traversal attacks. Use secure coding practices such as input sanitization and proper file path handling to prevent malicious exploitation of this vulnerability."
