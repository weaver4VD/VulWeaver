        "justification": "The code is partially valid as it does free the memory for atusb struct, but it continues to access atusb struct members after freeing it. To address this vulnerability, the code should set the atusb pointer to NULL after freeing the memory and add proper checks before accessing any atusb struct members to ensure they are not NULL. Failing to do so could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior."
