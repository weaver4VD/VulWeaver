        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. While the suggested mitigation to add a check for 'nbytes' parameter is correct, it is important to note that the current code already has a check for 'nbytes >= MAX_DRC_NAME_LEN'. However, the additional check to ensure 'nbytes' does not exceed the maximum length allowed for 'drc_name' before copying the data can further enhance the security of the code. Therefore, the severity is medium as there is already a partial mitigation in place, but it is recommended to implement the additional check to fix the vulnerability immediately."
