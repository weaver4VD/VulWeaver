    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified two vulnerabilities in the code: Buffer Overflow and Memory Leak. The Buffer Overflow vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking before writing data to the usb_msg structure, which could lead to memory corruption. The Memory Leak vulnerability occurs due to not setting the ctx pointer to NULL after freeing memory, potentially causing a continuous loss of memory resources.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the Buffer Overflow vulnerability and proposed a mitigation strategy by implementing bounds checking to prevent overflows. For the Memory Leak vulnerability, the Code Author also recognized the issue and suggested setting the ctx pointer to NULL after freeing memory to prevent memory leaks."

Setting the ctx pointer to NULL after freeing memory is essential to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient memory management. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."
