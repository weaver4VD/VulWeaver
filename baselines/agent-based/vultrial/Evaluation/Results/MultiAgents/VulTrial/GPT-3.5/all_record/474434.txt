The recommendation to initialize the entire object, including its attributes, is valid. However, the Code Author's response to uncomment the line that initializes the object attributes using MemorySet(&object->attributes, 0, sizeof(OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES)); is only a partial solution. It is important to also initialize the entire object using MemorySet(object, 0, sizeof(*object)) to fully mitigate the vulnerability."
