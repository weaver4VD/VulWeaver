        "justification": "The code indeed lacks input validation on the 'id' parameter, which can lead to potential security issues. The Security Researcher's suggestion to implement input validation checks is valid and should be followed. However, the severity is considered medium as there is no immediate exploitation scenario mentioned, and the impact is not clearly defined. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid."
