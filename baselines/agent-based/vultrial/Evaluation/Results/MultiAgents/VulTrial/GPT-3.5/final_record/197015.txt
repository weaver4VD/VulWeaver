        "justification": "The Potential NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability is invalid as the code already checks for the allocation success of writer->stsc using the GF_SAFEALLOC macro. If the allocation fails, it returns GF_OUT_OF_MEM, preventing any NULL pointer dereference. The existing implementation handles this scenario effectively."
