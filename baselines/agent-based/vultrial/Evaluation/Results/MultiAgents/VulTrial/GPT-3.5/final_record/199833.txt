The code indeed lacks proper boundary checking when accessing arrays, which could lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause denial of service. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing proper boundary checks and using safer functions like 'memcpy' with size checks."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The code allocates memory for 'frame_data' but does not properly deallocate it, leading to memory leaks. This could result in performance degradation or system instability over time. The severity is medium as it can impact system resources. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing proper memory deallocation mechanisms using 'free' or appropriate memory management functions."
