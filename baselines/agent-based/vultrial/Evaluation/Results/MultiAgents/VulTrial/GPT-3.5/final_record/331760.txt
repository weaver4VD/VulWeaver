        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code indeed allocates memory for 'd->strokeHandler' using 'new' but does not deallocate it, leading to a memory leak. The impact of this vulnerability can be significant, causing excessive memory usage and potential crashes. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to include a destructor or cleanup function is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks and excessive memory consumption."
