        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about insecure memory handling is valid as sensitive data like the encryption key is not securely cleared from memory. The recommended mitigation of securely clearing sensitive data from memory after use is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and memory scraping attacks."
