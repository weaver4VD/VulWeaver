        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about integer overflow is valid. The code lacks a check to ensure that the result of calculating ctrl->data_port does not exceed the maximum value that can be stored in the data type used for data_port. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. Adding a check to prevent integer overflow is necessary to address this vulnerability."
