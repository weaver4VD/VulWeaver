        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does free the memory allocated for 'types' by using g_steal_pointer(&types), but it does not free each element of 'types' before freeing 'types' itself. This can lead to memory leaks over time. It is recommended to add a loop to free each element of 'types' before freeing 'types'."
