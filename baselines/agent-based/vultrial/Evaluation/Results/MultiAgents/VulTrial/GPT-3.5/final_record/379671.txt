The Code Author's response to mitigate the issue by adding appropriate memory deallocation is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks and maintain stable memory usage."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential buffer overflow due to the use of 'strncpy' is refuted by the Code Author's explanation that the code does not use 'strncpy' for string manipulation. Instead, it uses 'strstr' for searching substrings, which does not involve string copying and therefore does not pose a buffer overflow risk. The code is designed to handle string manipulation safely without exceeding buffer boundaries."
