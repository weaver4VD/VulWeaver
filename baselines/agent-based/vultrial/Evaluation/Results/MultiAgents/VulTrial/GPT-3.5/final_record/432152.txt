This can lead to untrusted inputs being accepted, potentially allowing attackers to inject and execute malicious code within the application context. The severity is high due to the critical impact it can have on the security of the system."

        "justification": "The vulnerability of insecure comparison is valid as the comparison 'sampleSize > numRecords * kMaxSampleRatioForRandCursor' can lead to integer overflow. It is recommended to use appropriate data types or bounds checking to handle large numbers safely and avoid potential vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as it can result in unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to manipulate the comparison result."
