    "decision": "partially valid",
    "severity": "medium",
    "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
    "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow due to unchecked allocation. The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy. However, the code still lacks the check to limit the allocation of return_data, making it partially valid. This issue should be fixed immediately to prevent buffer overflow."
