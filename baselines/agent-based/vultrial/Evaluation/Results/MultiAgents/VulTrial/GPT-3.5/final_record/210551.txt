The proposed mitigation strategy by the Security Researcher to implement an explicit depth check or limit is valid and should be applied to prevent excessive stack consumption. However, the code author has not implemented this mitigation yet, making it only partially valid."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the memory exhaustion vulnerability in the code due to lack of proper error handling and memory management. This can lead to memory leaks and denial of service attacks. The impact of memory exhaustion vulnerabilities is significant, and immediate action is required to fix the memory management issues in the code."
