        "justification": "The code does not implement proper bounds checking when appending data to the 'outbuf' variable, which could lead to a buffer overflow. The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it could result in memory corruption, crashes, or remote code execution. The severity is medium as it poses a serious risk. Immediate action is recommended to address this issue."

        "justification": "The code lacks input validation checks before processing the 'line' variable, making it vulnerable to various security issues such as buffer overflows and injection attacks. The impact of unvalidated input is severe, leading to potential security breaches. The severity is high due to the critical nature of the vulnerability. Immediate action is necessary to mitigate this risk."

        "justification": "The code does not free the memory allocated for 'escaped_selector', leading to a memory leak. While memory leaks can cause resource exhaustion over time, the impact in this case is considered low as it may not immediately affect system performance. However, it is still important to address this issue promptly to prevent long-term issues. Immediate action is advised to fix the memory leak."
