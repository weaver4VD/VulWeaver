The Code Author acknowledged the issue and suggested implementing proper bounds checking to mitigate the risk.

The Code Author acknowledged the issue and recommended validating input to prevent integer overflow. However, the validation mechanism was not explicitly implemented in the code, making it only partially valid.

The Code Author recognized the issue and suggested implementing input validation mechanisms. While the recommendation addresses the vulnerability, it was not explicitly implemented in the code, making it only partially valid. The severity is low as exploiting this vulnerability could result in data corruption or manipulation of application behavior."
