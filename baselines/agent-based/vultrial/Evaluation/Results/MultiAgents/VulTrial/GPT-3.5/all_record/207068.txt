While the suggested mitigation to add a check for 'nbytes' parameter is effective in preventing buffer overflow, it is important to also ensure that the buffer size is properly defined and that the memcpy operation does not exceed the buffer size. The impact of a buffer overflow can be severe, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even remote code execution."
