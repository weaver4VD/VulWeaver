        "justification": "The code is partially valid as it lacks input validation for the 'inode' parameter before using it in the remove_inode_hash() and get_fuse_inode() functions. This can lead to potential risks such as NULL pointer dereference or memory manipulation. Adding input validation to check for NULL or valid memory location can help mitigate these risks."
