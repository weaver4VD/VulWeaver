This poses a high risk as it can result in memory corruption or security exploits. Immediate action is required to implement bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow."

        "justification": "The Incomplete Input Validation vulnerability is valid as the code does not thoroughly validate input data size before copying it to the DMA buffer, leading to potential unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. While not as critical as buffer overflow, it still poses a medium risk. Immediate action is recommended to implement proper input validation checks."

        "justification": "The Incomplete Error Handling vulnerability is valid as the code lacks robust error handling for DMA mapping operations, which can result in disruptions or denial of service conditions. This poses a medium risk. Immediate action is necessary to enhance error handling mechanisms and ensure proper error checking and recovery procedures."
