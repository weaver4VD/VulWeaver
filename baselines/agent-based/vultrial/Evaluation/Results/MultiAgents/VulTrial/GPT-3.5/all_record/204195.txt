The Security Researcher's concern is valid. However, the Code Author has acknowledged the risk and suggested implementing proper bounds checking as a mitigation strategy. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a high severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately to prevent potential exploitation."
