        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code does not free the memory allocated for 'a' if the allocation for 'a->obu' fails, leading to a memory leak. This could result in a gradual increase in memory consumption over time, potentially leading to performance degradation or denial of service. Adding a check to free the memory allocated for 'a' if the allocation for 'a->obu' fails will help mitigate this issue."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. No bounds checking is performed when reading data into 'a->obu' from the bitstream, which could lead to buffer overflow if the buffer size is exceeded. This could result in potential corruption of adjacent memory, leading to crashes, data manipulation, or execution of arbitrary code. Implementing bounds checking when reading data into 'a->obu' from the bitstream is crucial to prevent this vulnerability."
