While the code does have a comparison that could lead to overflow, the impact is medium as it may result in unexpected behavior. Adding additional checks to ensure values are within a reasonable range before comparison is recommended to mitigate this risk."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's observation of an insufficient capability check is valid and has a high severity impact. The code lacks robust access control checks, which could lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized resource usage. Enhancing permission validation with more robust checks is necessary to prevent unauthorized users from manipulating resource limits beyond their permissions."
