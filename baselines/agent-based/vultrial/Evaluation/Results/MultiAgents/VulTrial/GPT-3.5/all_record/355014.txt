This can be achieved by adding an additional check to limit the length of the copied BYE reason to the maximum buffer size. For example, before copying the BYE reason, the code can compare 'reason.slen' with the maximum buffer size and adjust 'reason.slen' accordingly to prevent buffer overflow."

The code lacks proper bounds checking to ensure that the BYE reason does not exceed the allocated buffer size. The suggested mitigation provided by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
