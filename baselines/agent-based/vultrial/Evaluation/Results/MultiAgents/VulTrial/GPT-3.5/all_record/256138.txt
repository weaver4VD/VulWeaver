By using smart pointers, memory will be automatically released when it goes out of scope, even in the presence of exceptions or early returns."

The Code Author also acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy using smart pointers. However, the code still uses raw pointers in several places without proper memory cleanup, indicating that the mitigation strategy has not been fully implemented. Therefore, the vulnerability is considered partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
