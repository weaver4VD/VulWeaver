        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential vulnerability in the code where 'pooling_ratio_' values are not validated for zero before division. The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy aligns with best practices. However, the code still lacks the actual implementation of the validation check and error handling mechanism, making it only partially valid. The severity is medium as it could lead to a crash or unexpected behavior."
