This can be achieved by limiting the number of characters read to the size of the buffer minus one to ensure there is always space for the null terminator."

The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential risk of overwriting adjacent memory locations. The proposed mitigation strategy by the Code Author is valid, but it has not been implemented in the code. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a high severity, and immediate action is recommended to add bounds checking."
