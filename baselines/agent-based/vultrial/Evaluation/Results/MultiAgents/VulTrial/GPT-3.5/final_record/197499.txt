        "justification": "The vulnerability of buffer overflow is partially valid as the code lacks proper bounds checking before reading integer values from the bitstream. Implementing bounds checking for NbBits and nbFields would help prevent buffer overflows. The severity is medium because an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute malicious code."

        "justification": "The vulnerability of uninitialized variables is valid as the variables qp_local, qp_on, and initial_qp are not initialized before usage. Initializing these variables with appropriate default values will ensure predictable behavior and reduce security risks. The severity is low, but it is important to fix immediately to prevent potential vulnerabilities."

        "justification": "The vulnerability of potential memory leaks is valid as the code lacks proper error handling mechanisms to deallocate allocated memory in case of errors. Implementing a cleanup routine for resource deallocation during node registration is crucial to prevent memory leaks. The severity is medium as memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service."
