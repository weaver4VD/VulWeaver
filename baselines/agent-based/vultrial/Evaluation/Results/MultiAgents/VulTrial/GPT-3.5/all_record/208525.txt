The impact of these vulnerabilities could lead to memory corruption, crashes, and potential code execution or unauthorized command execution.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the Buffer Overflow vulnerability and proposed mitigation by implementing proper input validation and size checking in the 'cmdline_paste' function. Similarly, for the Unrestricted Command Injection vulnerability, the author suggested implementing input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized command injection."
