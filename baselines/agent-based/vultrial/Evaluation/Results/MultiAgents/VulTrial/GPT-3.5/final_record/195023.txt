The Security Researcher's recommendation to implement proper memory deallocation is valid. However, the code may already have mechanisms in place for memory management that were not explicitly shown. It is partially valid as the existing memory management approach needs to be verified and improved if necessary."

        "justification": "The code lacks checks to prevent integer overflow before performing multiplication operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The Security Researcher's suggestion to implement checks for potential overflow is valid and crucial for ensuring the code's reliability and security. Immediate action is recommended to address this high-severity vulnerability."
