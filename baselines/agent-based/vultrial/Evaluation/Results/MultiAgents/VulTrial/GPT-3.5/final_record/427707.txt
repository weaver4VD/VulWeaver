        "justification": "The code does have a potential vulnerability related to integer overflow when calculating the value of 'offs'. The Security Researcher's concern is valid as it can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The suggested mitigation by the Security Researcher is appropriate to add a check to ensure 'offs' does not exceed UINT32_MAX divided by 4. This would help mitigate the risk of integer overflow and prevent potential exploitation by attackers."
