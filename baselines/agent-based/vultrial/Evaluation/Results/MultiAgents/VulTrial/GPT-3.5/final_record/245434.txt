The code does use sprintf without specifying the buffer size, which can lead to a buffer overflow. This can have a medium severity impact, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by replacing sprintf with a safer alternative like snprintf to prevent buffer overrun."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The code does not free the memory allocated for esd->URLString before reassignment, leading to a potential memory leak. While this vulnerability has a low severity impact, if exploited multiple times, it can lead to memory exhaustion. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by ensuring that the previously allocated memory is freed before assigning new values to prevent memory leaks."
