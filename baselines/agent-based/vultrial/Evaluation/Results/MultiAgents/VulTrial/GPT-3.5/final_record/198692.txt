The code does have a potential risk of memory corruption due to lack of bounds checking for arrays 'x_cur' and 'x_new'. The suggested mitigation by the Code Author to implement bounds checking and prevent buffer overflows is valid and should be addressed immediately to mitigate the risk of memory corruption, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or system crashes."
