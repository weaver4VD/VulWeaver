        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the 'count' variable is not thoroughly validated after reading values from the 'command' array, leading to incomplete input validation. This could result in memory access issues and unexpected behavior. Immediate action is needed to implement thorough validation checks to address this vulnerability."

This could lead to unauthorized command execution. Immediate action is required to sanitize input data and implement input validation mechanisms to prevent command injection."
