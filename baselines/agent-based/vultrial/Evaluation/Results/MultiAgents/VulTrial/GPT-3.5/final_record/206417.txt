            "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid due to the lack of input validation and bounds checking, which could result in integer overflow vulnerabilities. To mitigate this issue, proper input validation and bounds checking should be enforced to prevent arithmetic operations from exceeding the maximum limit of integer values."
