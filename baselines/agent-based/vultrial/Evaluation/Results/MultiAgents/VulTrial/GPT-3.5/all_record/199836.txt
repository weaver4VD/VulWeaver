        "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted input that exceeds the expected length, causing the program to read/write memory outside the allocated buffer. This could lead to a crash, unexpected behavior, or potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code."

This can be achieved by validating the current pointer against the allocated buffer size before reading the character value."

The suggested mitigation strategy by the Code Author aligns with best practices to prevent buffer overflows. However, since the code currently does not have these checks in place, it is considered partially valid. Adding boundary checks is crucial to prevent potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities."
