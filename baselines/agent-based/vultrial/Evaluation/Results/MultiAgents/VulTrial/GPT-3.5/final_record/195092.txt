Adding a default case in the switch statement for UnaryOperatorInst::OpKind would mitigate the risk of unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact is limited to potential future enum values. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any future vulnerabilities."
