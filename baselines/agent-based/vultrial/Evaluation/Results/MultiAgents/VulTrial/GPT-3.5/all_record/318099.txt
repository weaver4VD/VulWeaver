The allocated memory for rsi_dev->tx_buffer is not freed in all failure paths before returning from the function, which can lead to memory leaks. The suggested mitigation provided by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented to prevent potential memory leaks and ensure proper memory management. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately."
