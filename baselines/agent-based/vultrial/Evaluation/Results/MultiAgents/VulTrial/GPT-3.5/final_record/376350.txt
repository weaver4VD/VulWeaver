        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the lack of input validation for the keyid parameter in the gpg_ctx_add_recipient function, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. The Code Author's response also acknowledges the need for input validation measures. However, since the code does perform some validation by checking if keyid is not NULL, it is considered partially valid. The severity is medium as the lack of further validation can still pose risks."
