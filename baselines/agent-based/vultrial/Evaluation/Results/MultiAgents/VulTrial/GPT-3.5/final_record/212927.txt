        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid because the code indeed passes the 'buf' buffer directly to the receive function without any input validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to a command injection vulnerability. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to implement input validation and sanitization is valid and should be applied to reduce the risk of exploitation."
