        "justification": "The code lacks input validation for the 'stamp_token' and 'tree_ensemble_serialized' inputs, which can lead to security issues. While the Security Researcher's suggestion to add input validation is valid, the Code Author has already implemented error handling for invalid inputs. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and immediate action is recommended to enhance input validation."

        "justification": "The code is vulnerable to memory leaks as the allocated memory for 'result' is not released in case of initialization errors. The Security Researcher's recommendation to implement proper memory management using smart pointers or RAII is valid. The severity of this vulnerability is high, and immediate action is required to prevent memory leaks and potential application crashes."
