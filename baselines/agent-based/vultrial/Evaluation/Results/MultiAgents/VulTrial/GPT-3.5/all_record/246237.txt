    "reason": "The calculation involving sel1XSum and sel2XSum is based on the values of sel1 and sel2, which are constrained within the range of valid inputs. As the values are derived from user input or predefined constants, there is no possibility of integer overflow in this context. Therefore, the concern regarding integer overflow is unfounded.",
