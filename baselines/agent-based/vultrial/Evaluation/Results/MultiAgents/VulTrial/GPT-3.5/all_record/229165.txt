Adding a check to ensure that the length of 'buf' does not exceed the size of 'elem.in_sg' is a valid mitigation strategy. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of buffer overflow can lead to memory corruption or crashes. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any potential exploits."
