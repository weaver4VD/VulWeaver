An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly opening new file descriptors without closing them, causing the system to run out of available file descriptors.",

        "reason": "The code does not free the allocated memory for 'servinfo' in all error scenarios before returning from the function. If an error occurs before the 'freeaddrinfo' call, the 'servinfo' memory will not be freed, resulting in a memory leak. An attacker could potentially trigger this vulnerability by causing the function to encounter errors without proper cleanup, leading to memory leaks over time.",

    "response_type": "mitigation",
    "reason": "To mitigate the potential resource exhaustion vulnerability, the code should implement a mechanism to limit the number of file descriptors that can be opened at any given time. This can be achieved by tracking the number of open file descriptors and enforcing a maximum limit. Additionally, the code should ensure that file descriptors are properly closed after use to prevent resource exhaustion."

{
    "vulnerability": "Potential Memory Leak",
    "response_type": "mitigation",
    "reason": "To mitigate the potential memory leak vulnerability, the code should free the allocated memory for 'servinfo' in all error scenarios before returning from the function. This can be achieved by adding a cleanup step before returning in case of errors, ensuring that 'servinfo' memory is freed even in error conditions. By properly handling memory cleanup, the code can prevent memory leaks and maintain stable memory consumption."
