This could lead to memory corruption and potential security risks. The proposed mitigation of implementing bounds checking is crucial to prevent buffer overflows and ensure memory safety."

This could lead to excessive memory consumption and resource exhaustion. Implementing input validation to limit the value of 'max_path_depth' is essential to prevent resource exhaustion scenarios and maintain system stability."

This could lead to resource depletion and denial of service issues. Implementing proper resource management to ensure all files are correctly closed is necessary to prevent resource leaks and maintain system integrity."
