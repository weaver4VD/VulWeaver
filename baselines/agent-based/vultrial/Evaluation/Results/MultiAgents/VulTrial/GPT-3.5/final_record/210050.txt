        "justification": "The code does use user input (variable name) without proper validation or sanitization, which can lead to a Lua Injection vulnerability. The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it can result in unauthorized access or system compromise. The author's suggestion of implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques is valid and should be followed to mitigate the risk. However, the code snippet provided does not show the complete context of how user input is handled, so further analysis is needed to fully assess the vulnerability."
