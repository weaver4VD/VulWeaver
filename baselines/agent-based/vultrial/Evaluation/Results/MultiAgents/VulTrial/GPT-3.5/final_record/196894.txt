        "justification": "The identified potential race condition in the code due to the use of OpenMP directives for parallel processing can indeed lead to concurrent access and modification of shared variables 'cp' and 'cq', potentially resulting in incorrect calculations and compromising cryptographic operations. The proposed mitigation strategy by the Code Author to use critical sections or atomic operations for proper synchronization is valid and should be implemented to minimize the risk of race conditions."
