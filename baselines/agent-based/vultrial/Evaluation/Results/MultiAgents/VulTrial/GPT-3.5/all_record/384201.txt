The Security Researcher correctly pointed out the risk of unintended fallthrough behavior in the code. However, the code already includes a 'break' statement after the 'fallthrough' comment, which mitigates the risk to some extent. It is recommended to ensure that all case blocks have explicit 'break' statements to prevent any unintended fallthrough behavior."
