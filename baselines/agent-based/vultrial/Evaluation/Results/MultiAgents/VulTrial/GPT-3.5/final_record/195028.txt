        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential integer overflow vulnerability in the code due to inadequate checks on the total size calculation. The suggested mitigation strategy of adding additional checks to validate width, height, and total size is valid. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of integer overflow can lead to memory corruption or crashes. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher accurately pointed out the incomplete input validation for the 'op_type_' parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security risks. The suggested mitigation strategy was not provided by the Code Author, but the response type aligns with the recommended action of fixing immediately. The severity is high as unauthorized 'op_type_' values could potentially expose sensitive information or execute unintended operations."
