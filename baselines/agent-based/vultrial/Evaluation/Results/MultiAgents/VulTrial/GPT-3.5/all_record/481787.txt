The Code Author's response also acknowledges this issue and suggests implementing proper input validation. However, the severity is considered high due to the potential impact of arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing the suggested mitigation measures."
