This can be achieved by checking if 'index' is non-negative and less than the size of the 'tuple' before proceeding with the Peek operation. Additionally, using unsigned integers for 'index' can prevent negative values from causing an overflow."

However, the provided mitigation advice from the Author is also valid and provides a solution to address the vulnerability. Therefore, the vulnerability is considered partially valid with a medium severity, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately by implementing the suggested input validation."
