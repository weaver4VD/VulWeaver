        "justification": "The code snippet provided by the Security Researcher correctly identifies a memory leak vulnerability in the code. The suggested mitigation of freeing the allocated memory for 'name' if the insertion into 'info->line_info_offset_comp_dir' fails is a valid solution to prevent memory leaks. Failing to free the memory can lead to excessive memory consumption and potential application crashes."
