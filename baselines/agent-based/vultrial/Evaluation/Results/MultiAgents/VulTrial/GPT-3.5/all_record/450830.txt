moderator: {
    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified two vulnerabilities in the code: Buffer Overflow and Memory Leak. The Buffer Overflow vulnerability arises from the lack of proper length checks for the AID and PARAMETERS fields, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or unauthorized access. The Memory Leak vulnerability results from the absence of a cleanup mechanism for freeing allocated memory, which could cause resource exhaustion and system crashes.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the vulnerabilities and proposed mitigation strategies. To address the Buffer Overflow vulnerability, the Author suggested implementing proper length checks and boundary validation for input fields to prevent buffer overflow attacks. For the Memory Leak vulnerability, the Author recommended adding a cleanup mechanism to release allocated memory resources, thereby avoiding memory leaks and maintaining system stability."
