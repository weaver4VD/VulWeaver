        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the memory leak vulnerability in the code where the 'copy' variable is not freed if an error occurs during memory reallocation for 'result'. This can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion. The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of adding a check to free 'copy' in error scenarios is valid and should be implemented to address the issue."
