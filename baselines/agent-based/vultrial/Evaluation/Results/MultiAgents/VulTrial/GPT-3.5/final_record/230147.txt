        "justification": "The identified memory leak vulnerability is partially valid. The Security Researcher correctly pointed out that the 'data_signed' variable should be freed before the function returns to prevent memory leaks. However, the Code Author's response also acknowledges the issue and provides the correct mitigation steps. Therefore, the severity is medium as it can lead to memory leaks over time, and the recommended action is to fix immediately."
