        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a potential vulnerability where the code does not check the return value of flatpak_bundle_load() before using the metadata variable, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. This could be exploited by an attacker to cause a crash or denial of service. The recommended action is to add a check to verify the return value of flatpak_bundle_load() and implement appropriate error handling to prevent this vulnerability."
