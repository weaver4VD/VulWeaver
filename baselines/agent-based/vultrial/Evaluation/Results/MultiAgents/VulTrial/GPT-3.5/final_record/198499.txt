The code lacks countermeasures to prevent information leakage through side channels, making it vulnerable to timing or power consumption variations. Implementing constant-time algorithms, data-independent execution paths, and secure random number generation can mitigate this vulnerability and enhance system security."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the vulnerability in the code related to weak random number generation. The code uses a weak random number generation method that can lead to predictable values, weakening the security of the cryptographic system. It is crucial to improve the random number generation to prevent attacks such as key guessing or exploitation of weak keys."
