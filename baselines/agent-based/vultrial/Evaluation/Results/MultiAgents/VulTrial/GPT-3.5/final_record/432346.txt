        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential integer overflow vulnerability in the code. Adding a check to ensure that the value of s->reg does not exceed the maximum index value of the edid_blob array is a valid mitigation strategy. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact could lead to out-of-bounds memory access. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any potential risks."
