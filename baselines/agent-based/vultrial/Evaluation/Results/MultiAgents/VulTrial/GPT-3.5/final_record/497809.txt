The Code Author provided a mitigation strategy to address this issue by implementing bounds checking and using safer functions like 'memcpy'. However, the code still lacks these safeguards, making it only partially valid. The severity is medium as exploiting this vulnerability could lead to memory corruption or unauthorized access."

The Code Author provided a mitigation strategy to address this issue by defining clear termination conditions and implementing safeguards. Since the mitigation is in place, the vulnerability is considered valid. The severity is low as the impact is limited to resource exhaustion and system instability."
