The Code Author acknowledged the issue and agreed with the proposed mitigation strategy. However, the code does not currently free the allocated memory for 'map' in case of an error, leading to potential memory leaks. Implementing the suggested cleanup step will address this vulnerability and prevent memory exhaustion."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code. The Code Author implemented a size check using 'snprintf' to prevent buffer overflow, ensuring that the buffer size is not exceeded. This measure effectively mitigates the risk of buffer overflow and makes the code safe from exploitation by attackers."
