This can lead to unauthorized access or operations on files, potentially resulting in data breaches or system compromise. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing robust input validation checks to prevent unauthorized access."

Without proper synchronization mechanisms, concurrent access to these flags could lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior, potentially causing data corruption or system instability. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing proper synchronization mechanisms to control concurrent access and maintain data integrity."
