        "justification": "The code indeed lacks a check to prevent 'numTriggeredTopics' from exceeding the maximum value of size_t, which can lead to an integer overflow. Adding a check to ensure 'numTriggeredTopics' does not exceed 64 is crucial to prevent this vulnerability. By implementing this mitigation, the code can avoid potential DoS attacks, memory corruption, or crashes."
