However, the mitigation suggested by the Security Researcher to implement proper bounds checking when calculating 'new_acts_size' can further enhance the security of the code by preventing potential integer overflow scenarios."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the code lacks bounds checking in the memcpy operation to ensure that the copy operation does not exceed the allocated memory bounds. The mitigation suggested by the Security Researcher to add bounds checking to the memcpy operation aligns with best practices to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be implemented to enhance the code's security."
