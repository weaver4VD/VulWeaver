The Code Author has acknowledged the issue and provided a mitigation strategy to set 'sk->sk_state' and 'sk->sk_shutdown' before calling 'release_sock(sk)'. However, the code should be updated to implement this mitigation to fully address the vulnerability. The potential impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it could lead to a crash, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution."
