    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified vulnerabilities related to Integer Overflow, Buffer Overflow, and Infinite Loop in the code. These vulnerabilities could lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, denial of service, overwriting adjacent memory, crashes, data corruption, execution of arbitrary code, and potential denial of service due to infinite loops.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the vulnerabilities and proposed mitigation strategies to address each of them. The Author suggested revising the calculation of 'end' to handle large 'size' values safely to prevent integer overflow, implementing proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow, and defining a clear exit strategy within loops to avoid infinite loops and potential denial of service. By implementing these mitigation strategies, the code can prevent the identified vulnerabilities and their associated impacts."
