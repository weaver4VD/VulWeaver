        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid as the code does use format strings without proper validation, which can lead to serious security risks. The proposed mitigation strategy by the Code Author is valid and should be implemented to prevent this vulnerability. However, since the code currently lacks proper validation, the severity is considered medium and immediate action is recommended."
