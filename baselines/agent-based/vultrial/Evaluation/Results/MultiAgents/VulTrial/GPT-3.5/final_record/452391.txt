This can be exploited by an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially causing a crash or arbitrary code execution."

            "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the allocated memory for 'generic_info' is not properly released before exiting the function, leading to a memory leak. This can degrade the application's performance over time. Proper memory management practices should be implemented to free all allocated memory and prevent memory leaks."
