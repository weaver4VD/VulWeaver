        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability of incomplete input validation is partially valid because the code lacks input validation for the 'c' parameter. Adding a check to ensure that 'c' falls within the expected range of values is crucial to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. The severity is medium as it can lead to unexpected behavior. Immediate action is recommended to address this issue."

        "severity": "high",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The vulnerability of potential memory corruption is partially valid as the code lacks proper bounds checking when accessing memory locations. Validating the 'c' parameter and ensuring memory operations are within safe boundaries is essential to prevent memory corruption, crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution. The severity is high as it can lead to critical issues. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."
