        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential memory leak vulnerability in the code where memory allocated for 'result' is not deallocated properly. The suggested mitigation of adding 'delete result;' statement at the end of the Compute function is valid. However, the severity is considered medium as memory leaks can lead to performance issues and program crashes over time if not addressed. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent any adverse effects."
