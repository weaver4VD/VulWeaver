        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the code snippet directly sets the state of the secure channel without proper authentication or validation checks, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the state. The Security Researcher's recommendation to implement proper authentication and validation checks is essential to mitigate the risk and maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the communication."
