        "justification": "The code indeed has a potential use-after-free vulnerability as identified by the Security Researcher. The mitigation suggested by the Security Researcher to set the 'skb' pointer to NULL after calling kfree_skb(skb) is valid and should be implemented to prevent the risk of accessing freed memory. The severity is considered medium as it could lead to arbitrary code execution or system crashes."
