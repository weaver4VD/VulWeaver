The Code Author acknowledged the issue and suggested implementing proper cleanup before returning NULL to mitigate the vulnerability. However, the code currently lacks the necessary cleanup steps, making it only partially valid. The severity is considered medium as it can lead to memory exhaustion and denial of service."
