While the recommendation to implement proper boundary checks is crucial, the severity is medium as the vulnerability could lead to sensitive data exposure.

Adding explicit checks for integer overflow is essential to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The severity is medium as integer overflow could lead to crashes or security issues. Immediate action is recommended to validate input broadcast_shape values and mitigate the risk."
