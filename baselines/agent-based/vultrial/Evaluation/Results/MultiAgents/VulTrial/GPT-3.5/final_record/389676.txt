Therefore, there is no direct exposure to untrusted input that could lead to code injection vulnerabilities. The code is secure in this aspect."

        "justification": "While the code does handle copying characters into allocated memory, there is a need for proper bounds checking and input validation to ensure that the input string does not exceed the allocated memory size. By enforcing strict limits and validating input size, the risk of buffer overflow can be significantly reduced. It is recommended to monitor and implement these additional security measures to fully address the vulnerability."
