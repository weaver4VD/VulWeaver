        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the presence of uninitialized variables in the code, which can lead to unpredictable behavior and security vulnerabilities. The Code Author also acknowledged the risk and provided a mitigation strategy. However, the code still lacks explicit initialization of variables before their use, indicating a partial validity of the vulnerability. The severity is considered medium as attackers could exploit these variables for malicious purposes. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately by initializing all variables to known states before their first use."
