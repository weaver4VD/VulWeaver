We can validate if col_arg is within a reasonable range of values to prevent integer overflow issues. If col_arg is outside the valid range, we can handle it gracefully by setting a default value or returning an error."

The Code Author's proposed mitigation strategy of adding a check to ensure col_arg is within a valid range is valid and should be implemented. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential exploits."
