        "justification": "The code is partially valid as it does check if the 'words' value exceeds the maximum buffer size before copying data from the user into the buffer. However, the code should also include proper bounds checking to ensure that the copy operation does not exceed the allocated buffer space. This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow if not fully addressed."
