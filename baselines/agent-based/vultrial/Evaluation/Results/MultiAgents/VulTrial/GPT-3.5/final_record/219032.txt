        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the memory leak vulnerability in the code where memory allocated for tensors in the 'outputs' vector is not properly deallocated. The Moderator's suggestion to modify the cleanup function to also free the memory occupied by the tensors is valid and should be implemented to mitigate the memory leak. This issue can lead to excessive memory consumption and potential denial of service, making it a medium severity issue that needs immediate fixing."
