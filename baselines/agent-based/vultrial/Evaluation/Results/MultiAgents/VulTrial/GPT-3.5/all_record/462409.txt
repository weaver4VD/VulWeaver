        "summary": "The Security Researcher identified three vulnerabilities in the code: Buffer Overflow, Integer Overflow, and Unvalidated Input. These vulnerabilities pose risks of memory corruption, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution due to improper bounds checking, arithmetic operations without validation, and lack of input sanitization."

They suggested implementing proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow, validating input to avoid integer overflow, and enforcing input validation mechanisms to address unvalidated input issues. These measures aim to prevent memory corruption, incorrect frame processing, and manipulation of application behavior."
