The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy of implementing bounds checking. However, the severity is considered medium as the potential impact includes denial of service, data corruption, and arbitrary code execution."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is partially valid as the Security Researcher correctly pointed out the direct use of '__FUNCTION__' in the format string for 'dprintf', which could lead to a format string vulnerability. The Code Author acknowledged the vulnerability and suggested proper sanitization of the '__FUNCTION__' value. The severity is considered medium due to the potential risks of information disclosure, memory corruption, and arbitrary code execution."
