However, the code does not explicitly show uninitialized or null objects being moved, reducing the likelihood of immediate memory corruption. Mitigation steps should be taken to add proper validation checks before using std::move."

While the code does not explicitly handle errors, the impact is currently low. It is recommended to add explicit error handling mechanisms to improve code robustness."
