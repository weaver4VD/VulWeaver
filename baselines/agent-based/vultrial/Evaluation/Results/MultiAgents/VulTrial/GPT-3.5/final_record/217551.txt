        "justification": "The code contains a clear buffer overflow vulnerability where the 'flag' array is defined with a fixed size of 4 but is used to store strings that may exceed this size. This can lead to serious security risks such as data corruption or arbitrary code execution. The recommended action is to fix this issue by defining the 'flag' array with a size that can accommodate the maximum expected length of the strings and implementing proper bounds checking."
