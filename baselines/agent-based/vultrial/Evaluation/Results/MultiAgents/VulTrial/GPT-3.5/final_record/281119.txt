        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. While the code does release some resources like xfrm_policy and xfrm_state in certain error scenarios, there is a potential for memory leaks if the function returns without releasing all allocated resources. To address this, the code should centralize resource deallocation in a single exit point to ensure all resources are properly released before returning."
