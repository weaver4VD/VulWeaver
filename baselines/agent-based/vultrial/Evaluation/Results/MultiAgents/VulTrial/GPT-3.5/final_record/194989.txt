The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy by suggesting proper bounds checking. However, the code currently lacks this implementation, making it only partially valid. The severity is medium as a buffer overflow can lead to critical consequences like crashing the application or executing malicious code."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the Security Researcher correctly pointed out the missing validation for 'number_bits' and 'image->columns', which can lead to integer overflow. The Code Author also acknowledged this issue and recommended adding validation checks. The severity is high as an integer overflow can result in memory corruption, denial of service, or remote code execution, posing significant risks."
