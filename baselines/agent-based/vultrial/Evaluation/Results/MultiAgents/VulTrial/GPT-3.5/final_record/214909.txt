The Code Author acknowledged the issue and proposed a mitigation strategy to validate the 'cq_size' parameter against the buffer size before writing to 'temp_cqc'. Implementing this validation will help mitigate the risk of buffer overflow. The severity is considered medium as a buffer overflow could lead to memory corruption and potential security risks."

        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is valid. The Code Author acknowledged the memory leak issue and recommended implementing proper error handling to free the allocated memory in error conditions. This will prevent memory exhaustion and denial of service attacks. The severity is considered low as it mainly impacts resource management and efficiency."
