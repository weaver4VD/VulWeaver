        "justification": "The code does not currently check for negative indices in the 'indices' tensor before processing them, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The Security Researcher's concern is valid as this vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to add a check in the loop to ensure non-negative indices is appropriate and should be implemented to address this issue."
