        "justification": "The Security Researcher identified a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the code due to copying data into a buffer without validating the data size against the buffer size. This could lead to memory corruption or crashes. The Code Author did not refute this claim, indicating that the vulnerability is valid and should be fixed immediately."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher highlighted a potential null pointer dereference vulnerability in the code, but the Code Author confirmed that the code already includes a check to handle NULL pointers gracefully. While the vulnerability is valid, the severity is low as the code handles this scenario effectively. It is recommended to monitor for any changes or updates in this area."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher pointed out a potential memory leak risk in the code, and the Code Author acknowledged the importance of proper cleanup routines to prevent memory leaks. The severity is medium as memory leaks can impact performance over time. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to address the risk of memory leaks."
