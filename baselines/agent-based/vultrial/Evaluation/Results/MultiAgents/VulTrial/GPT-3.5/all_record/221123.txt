  "reason": "To mitigate the potential integer overflow vulnerability, we can add additional checks to ensure that the width and height values do not exceed safe limits before calculating the total size. By validating the input dimensions against predefined thresholds, we can prevent integer overflow and reduce the risk of memory corruption or undefined behavior.",
  "impact": "If the dimensions are too large, the additional checks will prevent the calculation of total size from causing an integer overflow, thereby enhancing the overall security and stability of the code."
