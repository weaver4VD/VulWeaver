        "justification": "The code is indeed making deep copies of input tensors before calling the Reorder() function, which modifies the underlying buffers in-place. This can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities if not handled properly. The potential impact of memory corruption, crashes, or undefined behavior is severe, hence the severity is high. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately by ensuring proper handling of deep copies and validating memory allocation and deallocation processes."
