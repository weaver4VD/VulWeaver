It is important to explicitly specify a strong security policy and use a valid certificate to establish the secure channel securely, reducing the risk of attacks."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about insecure channel state assignment is valid. The code snippet directly sets the state of the secure channel to 'OPEN' without proper authentication or validation checks, which could allow unauthorized manipulation. This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or malicious actions on the server."
