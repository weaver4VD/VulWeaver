        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential memory corruption vulnerability in the code where the underlying indices and values buffers are modified in-place. Making deep copies of the input tensors before calling the Reorder() function is a valid mitigation strategy to prevent memory corruption. However, the code still needs to be updated to implement this mitigation and ensure the original input tensors are not modified directly."
