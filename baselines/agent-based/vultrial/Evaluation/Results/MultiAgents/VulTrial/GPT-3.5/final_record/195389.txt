        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential use-after-free vulnerability in the code due to storing pointers to OpDef::AttrDef objects. The suggested mitigation of storing copies of objects instead of pointers is valid and would help prevent the vulnerability. However, the severity is considered medium as the current code implementation poses a risk, and immediate action is recommended to address this potential vulnerability."
