The proposed mitigation strategy of adding a check after memory allocation is partially valid, as it addresses the issue but could be further improved by also handling the case where the allocation fails. The severity is medium as it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior."

The proposed mitigation strategy of adding a check to prevent overflow before multiplication is valid and effective. The severity is medium as it can result in memory corruption and security vulnerabilities."
