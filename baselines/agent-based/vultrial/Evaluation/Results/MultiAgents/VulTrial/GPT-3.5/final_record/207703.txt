        "justification": "The code indeed sets file permissions using the chmod function without proper validation, which can lead to potential security risks. The Security Researcher's concern about unauthorized access and system modification is valid. However, the Code Author's suggestion of adding a validation step for specific users or groups is a valid mitigation strategy. Therefore, the vulnerability is partially valid with a medium severity, and it is recommended to fix it immediately by implementing the suggested validation step."
