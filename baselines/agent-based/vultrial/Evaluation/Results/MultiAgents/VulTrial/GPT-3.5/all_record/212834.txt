    "researcher_summary": "The Security Researcher identified two vulnerabilities: Buffer Overflow and Integer Overflow. The Buffer Overflow vulnerability arises from writing to the buffer without proper bounds checking, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The Integer Overflow vulnerability occurs when calculating octatesToDiscard, which could result in unexpected behavior or memory corruption.",
    "author_summary": "The Code Author acknowledged the vulnerabilities and proposed mitigation strategies. For the Buffer Overflow, they suggested implementing bounds checking before writing to the buffer to prevent exceeding the buffer size. For the Integer Overflow, they recommended adding proper checks to prevent overflow when calculating octatesToDiscard."
