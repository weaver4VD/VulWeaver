        "justification": "The index out of bounds vulnerability is valid as the code lacks proper validation of indices to ensure they are within the bounds of the memory space. Without this validation, there is a risk of accessing memory locations outside the allocated space, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or unauthorized access to sensitive data."
