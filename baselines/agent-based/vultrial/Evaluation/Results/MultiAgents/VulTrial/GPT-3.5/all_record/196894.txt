    "reason": "To mitigate the potential race condition in the code, the OpenMP directives should be used carefully to ensure proper synchronization of shared variables 'cp' and 'cq'. One approach is to use critical sections or atomic operations to protect the critical sections of the code where shared variables are accessed and modified. By properly synchronizing the access to 'cp' and 'cq', the risk of race conditions can be minimized, ensuring the correctness of the calculations and the integrity of the cryptographic operations."
