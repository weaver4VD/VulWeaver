While the Security Researcher's suggestion is valid, the code author has partially addressed this by handling errors related to these inputs. However, more comprehensive input validation measures should be implemented to fully mitigate the vulnerability."

The code author should generalize error messages to prevent revealing sensitive information. This is a low-severity issue but should still be addressed to enhance security and prevent attackers from gaining insights into the system."
