        "justification": "The code is vulnerable to a memory leak as the dynamically allocated memory for 'name' is not released if the insertion into the hash table fails. Adding a 'free(name);' statement after the insertion failure condition will mitigate this vulnerability and prevent potential performance degradation and resource exhaustion over time."
