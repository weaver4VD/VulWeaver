        "justification": "The code snippet does indeed have a memory leak vulnerability as identified by the Security Researcher. The allocated memory using malloc is not freed before returning NULL, which can lead to memory leaks. The impact of this vulnerability can be medium as it can cause performance degradation or denial of service. The suggested mitigation provided by the Security Researcher is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks."
