        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher regarding the 'line' buffer being allocated without a specific size is partially valid. The code does not have explicit bounds checking for the 'line' buffer, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the copied content exceeds the buffer size. This could result in arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure. To address this, the 'line' buffer should be allocated with a size that can accommodate the maximum expected length of the content copied from ml_get_curline, and bounds checking should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow."
