Setting the ax25 pointer to NULL after freeing the memory can prevent exploitation. The severity is high as exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution. Immediate action is recommended to fix this issue."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as there is a lack of NULL check before accessing the ax25_dev pointer, which could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. Adding a NULL check can prevent crashes during critical operations. The severity is medium as it could result in a denial of service. Immediate action is recommended to fix this issue."
