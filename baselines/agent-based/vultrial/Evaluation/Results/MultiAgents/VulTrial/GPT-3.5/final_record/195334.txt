This can lead to gradual depletion of memory and potential application issues. The severity is medium as it can impact application performance. The recommended action is to fix immediately by adding corresponding free operations."

        "justification": "The potential buffer overflow vulnerability is valid as the code lacks proper bounds checking for various values read from the bitstream, which could lead to buffer overflow attacks. The severity is high as it can result in crashes, unauthorized access, or execution of malicious code. The recommended action is to fix immediately by implementing bounds checking for the mentioned parameters."
