    "response_type": "mitigation",
    "reason": "To mitigate this vulnerability, proper input validation should be implemented for the 'output_elements' variable. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the value is within a valid range before proceeding with the operation. By validating the input, the risk of memory corruption, buffer overflows, denial of service attacks, and unauthorized access can be significantly reduced."
