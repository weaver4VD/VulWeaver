        "justification": "The vulnerability of arbitrary code execution is valid as the code calls the __wakeup() method on an object without proper validation and sanitization. This can lead to executing malicious code within the application context. To mitigate this risk, proper validation and sanitization should be implemented before calling __wakeup(). Additionally, restricting the use of __wakeup() to trusted classes is recommended."
