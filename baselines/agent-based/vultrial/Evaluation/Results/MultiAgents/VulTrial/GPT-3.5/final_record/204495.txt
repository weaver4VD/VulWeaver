While the recommendation to sanitize the 'fd' value before passing it to 'array_index_nospec' is valid, the severity is considered medium as the impact could lead to out-of-bounds memory access or other unexpected behavior. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to prevent potential exploitation."
