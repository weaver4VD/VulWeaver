        "justification": "The code does indeed have a memory leak vulnerability as identified by the Security Researcher. The allocated memory for 'tmp' is not freed before returning from the function, potentially leading to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The suggested mitigation from the Security Researcher to add 'free(tmp);' before the 'end' label is valid and should be implemented to address this issue."
