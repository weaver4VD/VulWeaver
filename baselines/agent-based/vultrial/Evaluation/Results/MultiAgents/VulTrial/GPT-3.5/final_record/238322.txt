        "severity": "medium",
        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential memory leak in the code where the allocated memory for 'tmp' is not being freed in case of an error before reaching the end of the function. The suggested mitigation from the Author to add 'free(tmp)' before 'goto end' is valid and should be implemented to prevent memory leaks. The severity is medium as it can lead to gradual memory exhaustion. Immediate action is recommended to address this vulnerability."
