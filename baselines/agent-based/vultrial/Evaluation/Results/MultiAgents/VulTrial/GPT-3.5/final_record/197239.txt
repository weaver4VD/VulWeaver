        "justification": "The Security Researcher's identification of the Integer Overflow vulnerability is valid. The Code Author's approach of using floating-point arithmetic to handle calculations effectively mitigates the risk of integer overflow. It is crucial to address this vulnerability promptly to ensure the accuracy and reliability of computations."
