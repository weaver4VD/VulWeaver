        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The calculation of 'j' in the code can potentially lead to an integer overflow if the sum of the comparison results exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in an integer variable. The suggested mitigation approach provided by the Security Researcher is valid and should be implemented to prevent integer overflow vulnerabilities. Therefore, the severity is medium as it could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately."
