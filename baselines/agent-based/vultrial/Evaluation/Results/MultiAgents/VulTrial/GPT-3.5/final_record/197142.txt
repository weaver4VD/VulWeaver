        "justification": "The code indeed accesses 'input_min_range' and 'input_max_range' tensors directly without validating their contents or ownership, which could lead to potential information disclosure. This vulnerability has a high severity as it could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from memory. The recommended action is to fix this vulnerability immediately by implementing proper input validation and access control mechanisms as suggested by the Security Researcher."
