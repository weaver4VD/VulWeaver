        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about potential NULL pointer dereference is valid. Adding a NULL check for 'state' before accessing its members can mitigate this vulnerability. However, the code already checks for NULL when allocating 'state', reducing the likelihood of this issue. Monitoring the code for any future changes that may introduce NULL pointer dereference is recommended."

Initializing the 'default_params' structure before using it will prevent information leakage or unexpected behavior caused by reading uninitialized memory."
