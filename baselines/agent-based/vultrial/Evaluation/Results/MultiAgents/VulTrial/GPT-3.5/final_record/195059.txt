The Code Author also acknowledged this vulnerability and provided a mitigation strategy. However, since the mitigation strategy was not fully implemented in the code, the vulnerability is only partially valid. It is recommended to implement additional checks to validate the input size of the node."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher pointed out the risk of null pointer dereference due to the lack of validation for the 'input' pointer. The Code Author also suggested adding a validation step to prevent this vulnerability. However, since the validation step was not implemented in the code, the vulnerability is only partially valid. It is recommended to add a null check before dereferencing the 'input' pointer to prevent potential crashes or security vulnerabilities."
