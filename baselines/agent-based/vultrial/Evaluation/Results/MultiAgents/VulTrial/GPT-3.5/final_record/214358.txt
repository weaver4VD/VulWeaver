The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is severe, potentially resulting in memory corruption or arbitrary code execution. The recommended action is to fix this issue immediately by implementing proper bounds checking to prevent buffer overflow."

This can lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption. The severity of this vulnerability is medium, and the recommended action is to fix it immediately by enforcing bounds checking to prevent integer overflow scenarios."
