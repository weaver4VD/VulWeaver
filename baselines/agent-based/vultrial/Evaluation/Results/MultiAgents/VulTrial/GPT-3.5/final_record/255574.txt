The suggested mitigation of using strncpy with explicit size limits is valid. However, the severity is considered medium as the impact of arbitrary code execution or unauthorized access to sensitive information is significant. Immediate action should be taken to address this vulnerability."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly pointed out the incomplete path sanitization vulnerability in the code, which could lead to path traversal attacks. The recommendation to perform input validation and sanitization on 'dir' and 'info->name' is valid. The severity is medium as the impact of unauthorized data disclosure or modification is significant. Immediate action should be taken to address this vulnerability."
