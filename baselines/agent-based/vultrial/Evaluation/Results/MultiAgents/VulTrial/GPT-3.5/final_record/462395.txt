        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The Code Author acknowledged the risk and proposed a mitigation strategy to validate the object and method before invoking `call_user_function_ex`. However, the implementation of this validation is crucial to prevent unauthorized code execution. The severity is high due to the potential impact of arbitrary code execution. It is recommended to fix this vulnerability immediately to enhance the security of the code."
