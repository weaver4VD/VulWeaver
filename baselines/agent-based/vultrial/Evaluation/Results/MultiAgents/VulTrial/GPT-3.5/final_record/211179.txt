By keeping this line commented out, the program avoids entering an infinite loop or crashing with large offset values. However, the code still needs to be fixed to prevent this vulnerability from being accidentally activated."

        "justification": "The vulnerability is valid as the Security Researcher correctly pointed out the memory leak issue in the 'tag == 0x927c /* MakerNote */ && count > 10' condition. The Code Author should add 'delete[] bytes;' after its usage to free the allocated memory and prevent memory leaks. This fix is necessary to ensure proper memory management and prevent resource exhaustion over time."
