The suggested mitigation by the Code Author to increase the allocation size is valid and should be implemented to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities."

The Code Author's response to educate developers on the importance of IVs and best practices is valid, but monitoring the usage of IVs and enforcing secure practices would be beneficial to enhance the security of the encryption process."
