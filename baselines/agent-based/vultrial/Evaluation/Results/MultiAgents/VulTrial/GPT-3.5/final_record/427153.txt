        "justification": "The vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher is partially valid. The code snippet does indeed use the input variable 'varname' without proper validation, making it susceptible to Lua injection attacks. The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it could lead to the execution of malicious Lua code within the application context. The recommended action is to implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent potential exploitation."
