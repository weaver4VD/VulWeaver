The Security Researcher's concern about potential exploitation leading to a denial of service attack is valid. The suggested mitigation strategy from the Code Author aligns with best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities. However, the code still lacks the necessary null check for hmhd before accessing its subType member, making it partially valid. It is recommended to fix this issue immediately to prevent potential crashes or exploitation."
