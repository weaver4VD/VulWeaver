		{
			"vulnerability": "Unrestricted Memory Allocation",
			"decision": "partially valid",
			"severity": "medium",
			"recommended_action": "fix immediately",
			"justification": "The vulnerability of unrestricted memory allocation is partially valid as the code uses malloc without proper bounds checking. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It is recommended to replace malloc with a safer memory allocation function like calloc and implement proper bounds checking to mitigate the risk."

		{
			"vulnerability": "Potential Integer Overflow",
			"decision": "partially valid",
			"severity": "medium",
			"recommended_action": "fix immediately",
			"justification": "The potential integer overflow vulnerability is partially valid as the code performs arithmetic operations without proper bounds checking. This can result in integer overflow. It is advisable to implement bounds checking before arithmetic operations to prevent overflow scenarios."
		},
		{
			"vulnerability": "Potential Command Injection",
			"decision": "valid",
			"severity": "low",
			"recommended_action": "monitor",
			"justification": "The potential command injection vulnerability is valid. Although the risk is low due to the internal usage of r_core_cmd0 function, it is still recommended to monitor for any future changes that might introduce command injection vulnerabilities."
