This can cause gradual increase in memory consumption and eventual out-of-memory issues. The severity is medium as it can impact system performance over time."

        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code contains conditional checks for m_ppDecodingMCU and m_ppUpsampler being NULL before allocating memory, but does not check for m_pFrame before accessing its member functions. This can lead to potential null pointer dereference, causing program crashes or unpredictable behavior. The severity is high as it poses security risks. It is partially valid as some checks are in place, but additional checks for m_pFrame are needed."
