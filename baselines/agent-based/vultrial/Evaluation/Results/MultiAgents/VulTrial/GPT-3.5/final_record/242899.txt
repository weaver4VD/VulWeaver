        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified the potential null pointer dereference vulnerability in the code due to not performing a null check on the 'done' callback before invoking it. The suggested mitigation from the Author to add a null check is valid and should be implemented to prevent crashes or undefined behavior. However, the code currently lacks this null check, making it partially valid. The severity is medium as it could lead to crashes or undefined behavior."
