While the Security Researcher's concern is valid, the code does attempt to handle control characters in header values. However, the validation mechanism is not comprehensive, leading to a partial validity. To address this, input validation should be strengthened to fully prevent CRLF injection attacks."

        "justification": "The Security Researcher's concern about unauthenticated response header manipulation is valid. The code allows response header manipulation without proper authentication checks, which could lead to unauthorized actions or information disclosure. To address this vulnerability, proper authentication checks should be implemented to ensure that only authenticated users can modify response headers, thereby preventing unauthorized activities."
