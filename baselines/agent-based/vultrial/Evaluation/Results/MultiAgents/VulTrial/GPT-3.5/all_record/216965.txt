This means that if the memory allocation fails, it will throw an exception rather than returning a NULL pointer. Therefore, there is no risk of dereferencing a NULL pointer in this context. The Code Author's approach of using 'new' with exception handling mitigates the risk effectively. No action is needed as there is no actual vulnerability in this case."
