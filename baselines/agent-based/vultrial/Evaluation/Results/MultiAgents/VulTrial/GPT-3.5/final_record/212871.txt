        "recommended_action": "fix immediately",
        "justification": "The code indeed concatenates user-controlled input without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to command injection. However, the use of functions like `utils::replace_all` and `stfl::quote` shows an attempt at sanitization. To fully address the vulnerability, additional input validation and sanitization techniques should be implemented, and consideration should be given to using platform-specific secure APIs for command execution."
