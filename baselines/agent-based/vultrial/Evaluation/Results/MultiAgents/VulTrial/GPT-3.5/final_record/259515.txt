        "justification": "The Security Researcher correctly identified a memory leak issue in the code where memory allocated for 'new_node' is not properly freed before exiting the function. This can lead to gradual depletion of memory resources and performance degradation. Proper memory management by freeing allocated memory is essential to prevent memory leaks."
