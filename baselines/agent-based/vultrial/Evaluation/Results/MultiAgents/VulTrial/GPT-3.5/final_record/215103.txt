        "justification": "The code does have a vulnerability related to arbitrary code execution due to lack of proper input validation for 'sampleSize' and 'numRecords' parameters. The Security Researcher's concern is valid. However, the code includes some validation logic based on sample size and collection type, which partially mitigates the risk. It is recommended to enhance the input validation to cover all possible scenarios and prevent potential exploits."

        "justification": "The code indeed has a vulnerability that could lead to information disclosure by leaking sensitive information like the collection name. The Security Researcher's concern is valid, and the impact of such disclosure is significant. It is crucial to review and revise the error handling mechanisms to avoid exposing critical system details. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential exploitation of this vulnerability."
