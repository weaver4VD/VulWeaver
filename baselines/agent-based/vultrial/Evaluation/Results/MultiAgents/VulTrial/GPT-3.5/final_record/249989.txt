The Code Author acknowledged this vulnerability and recommended adding a cleanup mechanism. However, the code currently lacks the cleanup mechanism, making it partially valid. The severity is medium as memory leaks can lead to resource exhaustion."

The Code Author also confirmed this by explaining the existing validation in the code. Therefore, this vulnerability is considered valid but with low severity as the code gracefully handles the NULL case."
