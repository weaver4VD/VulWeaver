This can lead to vulnerabilities if the comparison is case-sensitive and allows for similar attribute names with different cases to be considered unique. An attacker could exploit this by creating attributes with similar names but different cases to bypass the uniqueness check.",

This way, attributes with similar names but different cases will be considered the same, ensuring a more robust uniqueness check.",
