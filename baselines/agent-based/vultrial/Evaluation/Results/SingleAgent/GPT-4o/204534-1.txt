To determine if there is a security vulnerability in this code, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `stl_remove_degenerate` takes a pointer to an `stl_file` and an `int facet` as arguments, and it doesn't return anything. This is indicative of a function that modifies state.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if `stl->error` is set, and if it is, the function exits immediately. This is a good check for early outs in error scenarios.

3. **Degenerate Cases**:
   - The code checks if all three vertices in the facet are the same using `memcmp`. If true, it prints a message and removes the facet by calling `stl_remove_facet(stl, facet)`.
   - It further checks for other degeneracy cases where two vertices are the same and sets `edge1`, `edge2`, and `edge3` variables accordingly. If none of these degeneracy conditions are met, it exits as no degenerate facet is present.

4. **Neighbor Handling**:
   - It retrieves neighbors for the degenerate edges.
   - It checks if neighbors are `-1` and calls `stl_update_connects_remove_1` accordingly, modifying connections.
   - Updates are made to the neighbors of neighbors to reflect the removal connections.

5. **Facet Removal**: The function removes the facet using `stl_remove_facet(stl, facet)` regardless of whether the neighbors were valid or not.

6. **Nullifying Connection**: If `neighbor3` is valid (not `-1`), it updates connections and nullifies a specific neighbor relationship.

**Security Considerations**:
- **Data Integrity**: The function modifies neighbor references and removes facets based on conditions. Incorrect updates could lead to data corruption or logical errors, but without more information on the behavior of `stl_update_connects_remove_1`, `stl_remove_facet`, and structures, it's difficult to claim these as security vulnerabilities directly.
- **Bounds and Memory**: The `memcmp` calls should be safe if `sizeof(stl_vertex)` accurately reflects the size of vertex data. Assuming proper memory layout management, this should be safe. `neighborX` manipulation is bounded by logical conditions also minimizing risk.

Given the provided code, there aren't immediate indications of buffer overflows, race conditions, or data leaks present.

To make an explicit conclusion:

**NO: No security vulnerability.**

This conclusion assumes that the functions and structures used are safe and correctly implemented. Without additional context about the behavior of other involved functions like `stl_update_connects_remove_1` and `stl_remove_facet`, we base the analysis strictly on the presented code in which no immediate vulnerabilities are detected.
