To analyze the given code for potential security vulnerabilities, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Mutex Locking**: The function starts by acquiring a lock using a `lock_guard` with a `std::recursive_mutex`, ensuring that the critical section is protected against concurrent modifications. This is a good practice to prevent race conditions.

2. **Pipe Path Check**: The function checks if the path represented by `pipePath` is already in `pipeServerSockets`. If so, it throws a runtime error, avoiding duplicate listening on the same path. This appears to handle cases of duplicate paths correctly.

3. **Socket Creation**: 
   - A UNIX domain socket is created with `socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)`. The result is checked with `FATAL_FAIL(fd)`, which presumably exits or handles error cases. The use of `FATAL_FAIL` implies error checking is implemented, but without knowing its exact behavior, confidence in its safety isn't absolute.
   - `initServerSocket(fd)` suggests further initialization of the socket, though its implementation is not provided.

4. **Sockaddr_un Setup**: 
   - The `sockaddr_un` structure, `local`, is initialized with the address family `AF_UNIX`.
   - `strcpy` is used to copy the `pipePath` into `local.sun_path`. Normally, `strcpy` poses a buffer overflow risk, but in this case, UNIX domain socket paths are limited to a smaller, fixed size. The `pipePath` should be validated to ensure it does not exceed `sizeof(local.sun_path)`. If not validated, this notably represents a potential risk.

5. **Unlinking and Binding**: 
   - `unlink` is called to remove any existing socket file at `local.sun_path` before binding, a common pattern to ensure that stale socket files do not interfere.
   - Binding is done with `::bind`, and errors are checked with `FATAL_FAIL`.

6. **Listen and File Permissions**: 
   - The function calls `::listen(fd, 5)` to start listening for incoming connections, with a backlog of 5.
   - `::chmod` is conditionally called (not on Windows) to set permissions on the socket file (`rw-` and `x` for user), but it might not be necessary or secure for all use cases involving socket files. Incorrect permissions might allow unauthorized users to interfere with the socket.

7. **Tracking Open Sockets**: The descriptor `fd` is added to `pipeServerSockets` under `pipePath`.

### Conclusion:

- **Security Concerns**:
  - The use of `strcpy` could introduce a buffer overflow risk if `pipePath` is not adequately sized or validated against `local.sun_path` length.
  - The permissions set by `::chmod`, if too permissive, might allow unauthorized access or operations on the socket file.

Given these points, the code does show potential security risks related to buffer overflow and permission issues with the socket file. Therefore, the possibility of security vulnerabilities exists.

**EXPLICITLY: YES: A security vulnerability detected.**
