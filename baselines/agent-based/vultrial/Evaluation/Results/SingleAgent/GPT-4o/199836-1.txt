To analyze the given code for potential security vulnerabilities, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `pj_scan_get_char` appears to be designed to fetch and return a character from a scanner structure, indicated by `scanner->curptr`, which is presumably a pointer to a character array or buffer.

2. **Dereferencing**: The first operation is dereferencing `scanner->curptr` to obtain the character. There is an implicit assumption here that `scanner->curptr` is already pointing to a valid location in memory. If `scanner->curptr` is `NULL`, this could lead to a dereference of a null pointer, which is undefined behavior and a potential security issue.

3. **Null-Character Check**: The code checks if `chr` is null (`if (!chr)`), which is typically used to detect the end of a string or buffer. If a null character is encountered, `pj_scan_syntax_err(scanner)` is called, and the function returns 0. It seems that a null character is not expected in the scanned input.

4. **Incrementing Pointer**: The pointer `scanner->curptr` is incremented with `++scanner->curptr`. Without boundary checks, there's a risk this could move beyond the intended bounds of the character array, leading to an out-of-bounds read in subsequent operations.

5. **Whitespace Skipping**: The code checks if the current character is "probably" a whitespace and skips whitespace if `scanner->skip_ws` is set. The function `pj_scan_skip_whitespace(scanner)` likely involves further pointer manipulation without shown boundary checks, which could exacerbate potential issues if boundaries are exceeded.

Considering the above points, especially the risk of dereferencing a null pointer or falling off the end of the buffer due to lack of boundary checks, we identify vulnerabilities related to potential out-of-bounds access and null pointer dereference. These issues could indeed be security vulnerabilities, particularly if inputs are not validated elsewhere in the program.

EXPLICITLY: YES: A security vulnerability detected.
