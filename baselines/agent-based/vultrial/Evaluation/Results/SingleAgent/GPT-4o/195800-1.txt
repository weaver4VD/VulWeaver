To analyze the code for potential security vulnerabilities, let's go through it step-by-step:

1. **Function Purpose**:
   - The function `fmtutil_macbitmap_read_pixmap_only_fields` reads various fields from a "PixMap" structure, likely from a binary file, and updates the `fmtutil_macbitmap_info` structure `bi` with this information.

2. **Data Reading**:
   - The function makes use of `dbuf_getu16be` and `dbuf_getu32be` functions to read data from the file buffer `f` at various offsets relative to `pos`.

3. **Bounds Checking**:
   - The function reads multiple data segments from potentially unvalidated file input without any bounds checking to ensure the data being accessed is within valid memory range. This could lead to issues such as buffer over-read if incorrect or malicious file input is provided.

4. **Signed vs Unsigned Integers**:
   - The code uses signed integers (`i64`) for some operations and printing, whereas the data being fetched is unsigned. If the data goes beyond the positive range that can be shown by the signed integer (such as large values used for file sizes), it may wrap around or behave unexpectedly in logging statements. However, there is no clear security impact from this observation alone unless these values influence further security-sensitive decisions.

5. **Data Fields**:
   - Fields like `pdwidth`, `packing_type`, `pixelsize`, among others, are set without any validation. In particular, calculations with `pdwidth` have a condition but lack further checks for realistic or disallowed values.

6. **Output Control**:
   - Data extracted is predominantly used for debugging/logging purposes rather than performing critical operations that could lead to security issues. However, extensive unchecked data reading can still be problematic, especially in contexts outside of the immediate provided code that might use this data unsafely.

Considering these points, the code's primary vulnerability vector would be improper handling of input, specifically unchecked reads that might allow buffer over-read if invalid input is processed. In an environment where the input is trusted and guaranteed to match expected formats and sizes, this might not be a direct issue. 

However, in the context of security and handling potentially untrusted input (e.g., from files that could be modified with malicious intent), appropriate bounds checking would be a prudent addition to prevent overflow or similar issues.

EXPLICITLY: The analysis indicates (1) YES: A security vulnerability detected, primarily involving the lack of bounds checking on input data accessed from the file buffer `f`.
