Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if there are any security vulnerabilities.

1. **Input Validation:**
    - The code performs a series of validation checks using `OP_REQUIRES` to ensure that the dimensions and number of elements in the input tensors are as expected. This helps prevent issues such as the tensors not matching the assumed format.
    - Checks include: validation of the original input tensor's dimensions and number of elements, ensuring row and column sequence tensors have more elements than `out_rows` and `out_cols`, and checking that none of the input dimensions are zero.

2. **Handling of Dynamic Memory:**
    - The code utilizes temporary tensors and manipulates data with the Eigen library. Proper allocation and initialization of these temporary variables are performed. For example, the `in_backprop_tensor_temp` is set to zero before it is used, which prevents use of uninitialized data.

3. **Type Safety and Overflows:**
    - The code does type casting from various types to `double` for processing, which is a wider floating-point type, reducing the chance of overflow in intermediate calculations. Following calculation, it casts back to the original type `T`.
    - Special care is taken to avoid integer overflows in loop indices and calculations, especially in the loop where `num_elements_in_pooling_cell` is used to perform division.

4. **Contributors Calculation:**
    - The logic for calculating original contributors and for distributing values evenly seems sound, based on the pooling sequences. There are appropriate comments and checks to guide and enforce this logic.

5. **Casting and Precision Loss:**
    - The final step involves casting from `double` to type `T`, which could introduce precision loss if `T` were a type with less precision. However, this does not constitute a security vulnerability; at worst, it would lead to a reduction in output precision.

6. **Concurrency and Side Effects:**
    - While the provided code does not explicitly indicate concurrency, it is structured in a way (using TensorFlow constructs like `OpKernelContext`) that would typically be safe for parallel execution in a controlled environment.

In summary, the code is well-structured with appropriate checks and error handling, making sure that inputs are validated and output casting is safely handled. There are no obvious loops of concern for buffer overflows or similar vulnerabilities because of the reliance on Eigen and TensorFlow abstractions. All used constructs are typical for safe numerical computations in machine learning frameworks.

Based on the static analysis of the provided code snippet, I conclude:

EXPLICITLY: (2) NO: No security vulnerability.
