To analyze the provided code for potential security vulnerabilities, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `dnsc_load_local_data` is designed to load specific DNSCrypt local data into a given environment configuration.

2. **Memory Allocation and Copying**:
    - The function allocates memory for strings using `strdup` and checks for insertion with `cfg_str2list_insert`. 
    - The code safely logs an error message and returns -1 if the insertion fails.

3. **Iteration Over Signed Certificates**:
    - The function iterates over `dnscenv->signed_certs_count` and additional checks are performed to see if a certificate is rotated (shouldn't be published).
    - Each certificate is evaluated to see if it's marked as rotated, and if so, it skips that certificate, continuing with the loop.

4. **Integer Overflow Check**:
    - There is a guard against integer overflow in `rrlen` calculation. Overflow checks are present for the length of `dnscenv->provider_name`.

5. **Memory Allocation and Safety**:
    - Memory for the resource record (`rr`) is allocated using `malloc(rrlen)`.
    - It checks if the allocation is successful. If not, it logs an error and returns -2.

6. **Copying Data to the Allocated Memory**:
    - The `snprintf` function is used repeatedly to append formatted text into the allocated `rr` with a specified maximum size `rrlen - 1`. This attempts to prevent buffer overflows.

7. **Encoding Data**:
    - Non-printable characters are encoded into octal format, ensuring that invalid characters are handled correctly.
    - The code skips characters such as quotes and backslashes, which could prevent basic injection attacks in TXT records.

8. **Insertion and Freeing Memory**:
    - The created record `rr` is inserted into the local data list of the configuration using `cfg_strlist_insert`.
    - The dynamically allocated memory for `rr` is freed after insertion, avoiding memory leaks.

9. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - The code includes logging at various stages of execution, which helps understand potential issues during runtime.

**Summary**:
- The code makes a conscious effort to handle various potential vulnerabilities like memory allocation checks, integer overflow guards, secure use of `snprintf` to avoid buffer overflows, and proper escaping of characters.
- Although the function uses dynamic memory operations, all allocations have corresponding deallocations or error checks.

Having dissected the source code carefully:

(2) NO: No security vulnerability. 

The code appears well-structured with defensive programming practices to mitigate typical security issues.
