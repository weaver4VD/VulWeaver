Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine if there is a security vulnerability:

1. **Function Signature and Purpose**: 
   - The function `print_media_desc` is designed to output media description data into a buffer, `buf`, which has a size specified by `len`.

2. **Buffer Management**:
   - Variable `p` is initialized to point to the start of `buf`, and `end` is a pointer to the end of the buffer.
   - There is an initial check to ensure the buffer is large enough for the baseline output size: `if (len < (pj_size_t)m->desc.media.slen+m->desc.transport.slen+12+24)`. This is a preventive measure but doesn’t guarantee safety for further buffer writes.

3. **Writing to Buffer**:
   - The function copies strings and formatted data into the buffer `buf`.
   - Each step involving `pj_memcpy` and other increments of `p` are not explicitly checked to ensure `p` does not surpass `end`.
   - This is a potential buffer overflow risk since no bounds checking is performed after manipulating `p` within various loops and logic branches.

4. **Loops and Function Calls**:
   - When iterating over formats (`fmt`), bandwidth (`bandw`), and attributes (`attr`), outputs are appended to `buf`.
   - In these loops, as well as in the calls to `print_connection_info`, `print_bandw`, and `print_attr`, returns of these functions are not checked against remaining buffer space except by their return values. These return values are not validated for exceeding buffer boundaries.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - Although return values of helper functions are checked for failure (negative values leading to returns of -1), there is no explicit check for when `p` surpasses `end` after any writing operation. 

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since buffer overflow is a common security vulnerability associated with missing boundary checks when writing to a buffer, and given the lack of such explicit checks throughout this function, the function is susceptible to writing beyond the allocated buffer `buf`.

Therefore, after analyzing the code, the conclusion is:
**YES: A security vulnerability detected.**
