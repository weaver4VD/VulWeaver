To analyze the given code snippet, we will examine it for potential security vulnerabilities. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `display_dollar` appears to update the display in some way when working with text in a window. It handles multibyte characters and updates a cursor position temporarily to display a dollar sign if conditions are met.

2. **Redrawing Check**: The function first checks if `redrawing()` is not true and returns early. This check is common to prevent unnecessary operations if the UI is not ready for updates or if it is already in the process of being redrawn.

3. **Cursor Manipulation**: The function turns off the cursor display, saves the current cursor position (`save_col`), and sets a new cursor position (`curwin->w_cursor.col = col`).

4. **Multibyte Character Handling**: If `has_mbyte` is true (indicating multibyte character support), it adjusts the cursor position, handling the case where the cursor might be on the last byte of a multibyte character.

5. **Display Update**: It calls `curs_columns(FALSE)` to recompute window rows and columns, then checks if the new column (`curwin->w_wcol`) is less than the window width. If true, it uses `edit_putchar` to display a `$`.

6. **Restoration**: The original cursor position is restored before the function returns.

**Analysis**:
- **Buffer Overflow**: The function manipulates cursor positions in memory. However, it assumes that inputs and operations will be safe (e.g., `curwin->w_cursor.col = col`). If `col` exceeds the buffer length or memory bounds, it could lead to buffer overflow. Assertions or boundary checks are not visible in the given snippet.

- **Multibyte Handling**: The multibyte handling subtracts an offset in `curwin->w_cursor.col -= (*mb_head_off)(p, p + col)`. The `mb_head_off` function must ensure it does not produce negative indices or exceed line length.

- **Null Dereferences**: There are pointers dereferenced (e.g., `curwin`, `ml_get_curline()`), and the function assumes they are not null, which, if not guaranteed elsewhere, might cause null dereference issues.

- **Concurrency/State Issues**: If `curwin` or `ml_get_curline()` change by concurrent operations, state inconsistencies could arise.

Based on the analysis:

- The code assumes safety of input and cursor position without checks, potentially allowing for out of bounds memory write/read.
- Depending on the larger context, if `colnr_T col` or indirect accesses go unchecked, it could lead to vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows).

EXPLICITLY, based on the given code context without input validation and bounds checking, a security vulnerability could be detected. 

(1) YES: A security vulnerability detected.
