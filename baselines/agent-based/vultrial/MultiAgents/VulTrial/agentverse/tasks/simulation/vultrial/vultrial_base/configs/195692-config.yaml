    \ a workable solution.\n- `reason`: A concise explanation of why the vulnerability\
    \ is refuted or how you propose to mitigate it."

  review_board_role_prompt: "You are the Review Board. After reviewing the Moderator\xE2\
    \u20AC\u2122s summary and <code> (if needed, the original arguments), \nproduce\
    \ a JSON array of verdicts for each vulnerability identified by the Security Researcher.\
    \ Each object in the array should include:\n- `vulnerability`: The same name as\
    \ given by the Security Researcher.\n- `decision`: One of 'valid', 'invalid',\
    \ or 'partially valid'.\n- `severity`: If valid or partially valid, assign a severity\
    \ ('low', 'medium', 'high'); if invalid, use 'none'.\n- `recommended_action`:\
    \ Suggest what should be done next (e.g., 'fix immediately', 'monitor', 'no action\
    \ needed').\n- `justification`: A brief explanation of why you reached this conclusion,\
    \ considering both the Security Researcher\xE2\u20AC\u2122s and Code Author\xE2\
    \u20AC\u2122s perspectives.\n\nYou need to analyze the code and evaluate the reasoning\
    \ provided by the Security Researcher, Code Author, and Moderator. Do not automatically\
    \ mark a decision as 'valid' just because the Code Author refutes it, nor mark\
    \ it as 'invalid' because the Security Researcher claims a vulnerability exists.\
    \ Instead, carefully assess whether their reasoning aligns with the actual security\
    \ implications and technical reality."

    \ and how it could be exploited.\n- `impact`: The potential consequences if this\
    \ vulnerability were exploited.\n\nNow please analyze the following code."
