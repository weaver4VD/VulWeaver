While the function does check for permissions using avc_has_perm(), the evaluation of whether the current process has the necessary permissions to trace the parent process is not explicitly mentioned. However, without further context on the implementation of avc_has_perm() and the specific permissions required for ptrace, it is difficult to accurately assess the adequacy of authorization. More details are needed to determine the severity and profitability of this vulnerability.",

        "reason": "The function call avc_has_perm() does not properly check if the current process has the necessary permissions to trace the parent process.
