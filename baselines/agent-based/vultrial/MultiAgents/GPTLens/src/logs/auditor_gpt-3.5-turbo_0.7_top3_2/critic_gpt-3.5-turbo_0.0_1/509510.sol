This could indeed lead to SQL injection attacks if an attacker manipulates the 'name' parameter with malicious SQL commands. However, the severity of this vulnerability is not very high as it requires the attacker to have knowledge of the database structure and the ability to inject SQL commands. The correctness score is 7 as the vulnerability is correctly identified, the severity score is 6 as it could lead to data manipulation but not data leakage, and the profitability score is 5 as exploiting this vulnerability may not provide significant benefits to an attacker.",
