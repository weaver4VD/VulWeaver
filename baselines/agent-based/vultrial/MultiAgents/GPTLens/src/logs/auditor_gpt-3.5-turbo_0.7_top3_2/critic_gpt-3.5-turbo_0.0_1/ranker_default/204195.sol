This allows an attacker to provide a negative or excessively large reason length, leading to unexpected behavior such as reading out-of-bounds memory or causing a denial of service. The correctness of this vulnerability is high as it poses a clear risk to the system. The severity is moderate as it can lead to memory corruption or denial of service, and the profitability is also moderate as it can be exploited to disrupt the system. Therefore, I would rate the correctness as 8, severity as 6, and profitability as 6.",

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious RTCP BYE packet with a large reason length, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing arbitrary code.
