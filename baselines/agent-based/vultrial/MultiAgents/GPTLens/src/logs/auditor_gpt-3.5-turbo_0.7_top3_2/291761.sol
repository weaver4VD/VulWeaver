However, it then proceeds to access 'clt->paths_ev_mutex' and 'clt->paths_mutex' using mutex_destroy(). This can lead to a use after free vulnerability where the memory is accessed after being freed, potentially allowing an attacker to exploit this to gain unauthorized access or manipulate the system.",

However, if there are any other parts of the code that still reference 'clt' after it has been freed, it can lead to a use after free vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the freed memory to execute arbitrary code or crash the system.",
