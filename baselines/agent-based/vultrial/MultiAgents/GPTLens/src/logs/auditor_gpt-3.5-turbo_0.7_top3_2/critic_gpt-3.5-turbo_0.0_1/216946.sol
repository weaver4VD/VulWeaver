However, the severity of the vulnerability is not very high as the buffer overflow would only occur if the input LEX_STRING length is not properly validated. The correctness score is lower due to the lack of detailed explanation on how the buffer overflow could lead to potential code execution or crash. The severity score is moderate as it depends on the input data. The profitability score is also moderate as exploiting this vulnerability would require specific conditions.",
