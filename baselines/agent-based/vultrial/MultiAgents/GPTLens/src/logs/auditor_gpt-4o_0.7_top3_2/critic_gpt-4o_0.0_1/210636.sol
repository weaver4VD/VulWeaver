The `ax` structure is only freed at the end of the function, and the lock ensures that `tty->disc_data` is not accessed concurrently. The concern about another thread accessing `tty->disc_data` after it is set to NULL is mitigated by the lock, which prevents concurrent access during the critical section. Therefore, the reasoning does not accurately describe a use-after-free scenario.",
