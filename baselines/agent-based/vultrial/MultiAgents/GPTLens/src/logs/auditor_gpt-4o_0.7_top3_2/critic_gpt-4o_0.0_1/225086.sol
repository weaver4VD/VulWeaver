However, in this specific function, the addresses stored in the unordered_map are only used within the scope of the function and are not accessed after the loop ends. Therefore, the risk of undefined behavior is minimal. The vulnerability is not exploitable in this context as the addresses are not used after the function returns. The reasoning overstates the potential impact.",
