However, in many codebases, 'curwin' is often assumed to be valid due to the context in which such functions are called. The severity of this issue depends on the broader application context. If 'curwin' is guaranteed to be non-null by the calling context, this is not a vulnerability. However, if there is any chance 'curwin' could be null, this could indeed lead to a crash. The profitability of exploiting this is low unless an attacker can control the state of 'curwin'.",
