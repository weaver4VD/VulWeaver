If the input is controlled by an attacker, they could potentially exploit this to cause excessive memory allocation. However, the use of 'WithRank' ensures that the input is at least a 2D shape, which mitigates some risk. The severity is moderate because while excessive memory allocation is possible, it is not guaranteed to lead to a security breach without further context. Profitability is low as exploiting this would require specific conditions and may not yield significant benefits.",
