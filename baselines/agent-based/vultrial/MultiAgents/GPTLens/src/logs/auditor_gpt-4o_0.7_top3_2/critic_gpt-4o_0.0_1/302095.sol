However, the explanation lacks detail on how user inputs are handled within the function, which is crucial for assessing the correctness of the vulnerability claim. Without specific code examples or context, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of the SQL Injection risk. The severity of SQL Injection is high, as it can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation. Profitability is also high, as attackers can exploit this to gain sensitive information or control over the database.",

However, the explanation does not provide details on the file handling mechanisms or security measures in place, such as file type checks or size restrictions.
